abstract = {We explore the timing and spectral properties of GRS 1915+105 based on X-ray observations of NICER and Insight-HXMT during the long outburst from 2017 to 2021. We find a new class of variability in the rising stage of the outburst that differs from the formerly reported patterns of light curves. This new variability pattern, which we name class $\psi$, is characterized by several periodic mini pulses superposed on another longer periodic pulse. The periods are ∼130 and ∼10 s for the main pulses and mini pulses, respectively, based on the analysis of power spectrum density and step-wise filter correlation (SFC), where the SFC method has an advantage in finding the superimposed periodic components. The mini pulses become weak or disappear when the luminosity increases and the light curves change into the classical class $\kappa$. The class $\psi$ shows a softer spectrum with lower count rates compared to the class $\kappa$ during the main pulse. The new class $\psi$ shows peculiar timing and spectral properties compared to those of classic class $\kappa$, which can help us to explore the class transition mechanism in GRS 1915+105.},

abstract = {In this paper we significantly improve estimates of distance to the X-ray binary systems Cyg X-3 and GRS 1915+105. We report a highly accurate trigonometric parallax measurement for Cyg X-3 using the VLBA at 43 GHz, placing the source at a distance of 9.67+0.53-0.48 kpc. We also use Galactic proper motions and line-of-sight radial velocity measurements to determine 3-dimensional (3D) kinematic distances to both systems, under the assumption that they have low peculiar velocities. This yields distances of 8.95+-0.96 kpc for Cyg X-3 and 9.4+-0.6 (statistical)+-0.8 (systematic) for GRS 1915+105. The good agreement between parallax and 3D kinematic distances validates the assumption of low peculiar velocities, and hence small natal kicks, for both of the systems. For a source with a low peculiar velocity, given its parallax distance, Cyg X-3 should have a Vlsr near -64+-5 km/s. Our measurements imply a slightly higher inclination angle, and hence lower black hole mass for GRS 1915+105 than found from previous work by Reid et al (2014) and strengthen arguments from X-ray polarization that Cyg X-3 would be an ultraluminous X-ray source if viewed face-on.},

abstract = {GRS 1915+105 has been observed in an 'obscured' phase since 2019 May, exhibiting steady and low X-ray luminosities with sporadic re-brightenings. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive and wide-band analysis of the spectral and timing properties of the source during the period 2019-2021 using observations from AstroSat (SXT: 0.5-8 keV; LAXPC: 3-60 keV), the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) (0.5-12 keV), and the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) (3-60 keV). Spectral analysis reveals the presence of a highly variable obscurer (1022-1024 atoms cm-2) throughout the observation period. The source is detected in the low/hard state for most of the time, with the spectra being described by a Comptonized component ($\Gamma$ ∼1.16-1.79, kTe ∼2-31 keV). The source spectra steepen ($\Gamma$ ∼2.5), indicating a softening of the spectrum, during the rise of the re-brightenings. Various emission and absorption lines corresponding to the neutral Fe K$\alpha$, Fe xxv K$\alpha$, Fe xxvi K$\alpha$, and the Ni xxviii K$\alpha$ were detected, with the equivalent widths varying in the range 70 eV-3.5 keV. The column density of the absorbing plasma varied in the range 1016-1018 atoms cm-2 at a distance ≤2 × 1010 cm. Interestingly, the source is also seen to exhibit various variability classes ($\rho$, $\lambda$, $\delta$, $\chi$) at relatively low luminosities (∼0.01 LEdd) during the re-brightening phases. Different variability classes show the signature of quasi-periodic oscillations ($\nu$QPO: 20-180 mHz, rmsQPO: 7.5 per cent-16 per cent). The source showed a maximum bolometric luminosity (Lbol) of ∼0.01 LEdd (re-brightening phases) and a minimum Lbol of 0.004 LEdd (quiet phase) during the period. We discuss the possible disc dynamics around the black hole during this low-luminosity 'obscured' phase.},

abstract = {Black hole and neutron star X-ray binary systems routinely show quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in their X-ray flux. Despite being strong, easily measurable signals, their physical origin has long remained elusive. However, recent observational and theoretical work has greatly improved our understanding. Here, we briefly review the basic phenomenology of the different varieties of QPO in both black hole and neutron star systems before focusing mainly on low frequency QPOs in black hole systems, for which much of the recent progress has been made. We describe the detailed statistical properties of these QPOs and review the physical models proposed in the literature, with particular attention to those based on Lense-Thirring precession. This is a relativistic effect whereby a spinning massive object twists up the surrounding spacetime, inducing nodal precession in inclined orbits. We review the theory describing how an accretion flow reacts to the Lense-Thirring effect, including analytic theory and recent numerical simulations. We then describe recent observational tests that provide very strong evidence that at least a certain type of low frequency QPOs are a geometric effect, and good evidence that they are the result of precession. We discuss the possibility of the spin axis of the compact object being misaligned with the binary rotation axis for a large fraction of X-ray binaries, as is required for QPOs to be driven specifically by Lense-Thirring precession, as well as some outstanding gaps in our understanding and future opportunities provided by X-ray polarimeters and/or high throughput X-ray detectors.},

However, the observations with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) reveal an unexpectedly high polarisation degree, rising from 6\% at 2 keV to 10\% at 8 keV, which cannot be reconciled with standard models of thin accretion discs.

abstract = {SWIFT J1658.2-4242 is an X-ray transient discovered recently in the Galactic plane, with severe X-ray absorption corresponding to an equivalent hydrogen column density of $N_{\rm H,abs}\sim2\times10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. Using new Chandra and XMM-Newton data, we discover a strong X-ray dust scattering halo around it. The halo profile can be well fitted by the scattering from at least three separated dust layers. During the persistent emission phase of SWIFT J1658.2-4242, the best-fit dust scattering $N_{\rm H,sca}$ based on the COMP-AC-S dust grain model is consistent with $N_{\rm H,abs}$. The best-fit halo models show that 85-90 percent of the intervening gas and dust along the line of sight of SWIFT J1658.2-4242 are located in the foreground ISM in the Galactic disk. The dust scattering halo also shows significant azimuthal asymmetry, which appears consistent with the inhomogeneous distribution of foreground molecular clouds. By matching the different dust layers to the distribution of molecular clouds along the line of sight, we estimate the source distance to be $\sim$10 kpc, which is also consistent with the results given by several other independent methods of distance estimation. The dust scattering opacity and the existence of a halo can introduce a significant spectral bias, the level of which depends on the shape of the instrumental point spread function and the source extraction region. We create the Xspec dscor model to correct for this spectral bias for different X-ray instruments. Our study reenforces the importance of considering the spectral effects of dust scattering in other absorbed X-ray sources.},

abstract = {AX J1745.6−2901 is an X-ray binary located at only 1.45 arcmin from Sgr A*, showcasing a strong X-ray dust-scattering halo. We combine Chandra and XMM-Newton observations to study the halo around this X-ray binary. Our study shows two major thick dust layers along the line of sight (LOS) towards AX J1745.6−2901. The LOS position and NH of these two layers depend on the dust grain models with different grain size distributions and abundances. But for all the 19 dust grain models considered, dust layer-1 is consistently found to be within a fractional distance of 0.11 (mean value: 0.05) to AX J1745.6−2901 and contains only (19-34) per cent (mean value: 26 per cent) of the total LOS dust. The remaining dust is contained in layer-2, which is distributed from the Earth up to a mean fractional distance of 0.64. A significant separation between the two layers is found for all the dust grain models, with a mean fractional distance of 0.31. Besides, an extended wing component is discovered in the halo, which implies a higher fraction of dust grains with typical sizes ≲590 {\AA} than considered in current dust grain models. Assuming AX J1745.6−2901 is 8 kpc away, dust layer-2 would be located in the Galactic disc several kpc away from the Galactic Centre (GC). The dust scattering halo biases the observed spectrum of AX J1745.6−2901 severely in both spectral shape and flux, and also introduces a strong dependence on the size of the instrumental point spread function and the source extraction region. We build XSPEC models to account for this spectral bias, which allow us to recover the intrinsic spectrum of AX J1745.6−2901 free from dust-scattering opacity. If dust layer-2 also intervenes along the LOS to Sgr A* and other nearby GC sources, a significant spectral correction for the dust-scattering opacity would be necessary for all these GC sources.},

@article{Gallo2003_radio_x_correl,
abstract = {Several independent lines of evidence now point to a connection between the physical processes that govern radio (i.e. jet) and X-ray emission from accreting X-ray binaries. We present a comprehensive study of (quasi-)simultaneous radio-X-ray observations of stellar black hole binaries during the spectrally hard X-ray state, finding evidence for a strong correlation between these two bands over more than three orders of magnitude in X-ray luminosity. The correlation extends from the quiescent regime up to close to the soft state transition, where radio emission starts to decline, sometimes below detectable levels, probably corresponding to the physical disappearance of the jet. The X-ray transient V404 Cygni is found to display the same functional relationship already reported for GX 339-4 between radio and X-ray flux, namely Sradio ≅ SX+0.7. In fact, the data for all low/hard state black holes is consistent with a universal relation between the radio and X-ray luminosity of the form Lradio ≅ L X+0.7- Under the hypothesis of common physics driving the disc-jet coupling in different sources, the observed spread to the best-fitting relation can be interpreted in terms of a distribution in Doppler factors and hence used to constrain the bulk Lorentz factors of both the radio- and X-ray-emitting regions. Monte Carlo simulations show that, assuming little or no X-ray beaming, the measured scatter in radio power is consistent with Lorentz factors ≲ 2 for the outflows in the low/hard state, significantly less relativistic than the jets associated with X-ray transients. When combined radio and X-ray beaming is considered, the range of possible jet bulk velocities significantly broadens, allowing highly relativistic outflows, but therefore implying severe X-ray selection effects. If the radio luminosity scales as the total jet power raised to x > 0.7, then there exists an X-ray luminosity below which most of the accretion power will be channelled into the jet, rather than into X-rays. For x = 1.4, as in several optically thick jet models, the power output of 'quiescent' black holes may be jet-dominated below Lx ≃ 4 × 10-5LEdd.},

@article{Fender2004_BHXRB_jet,
abstract = {We present a unified semiquantitative model for the disc-jet coupling in black hole X-ray binary systems. In the process we have compiled observational aspects from the existing literature, as well as performing new analyses. We argue that during the rising phase of a black hole transient outburst the steady jet known to be associated with the canonical 'low/hard' state persists while the X-ray spectrum initially softens. Subsequently, the jet becomes unstable and an optically thin radio outburst is always associated with the soft X-ray peak at the end of this phase of softening. This peak corresponds to a 'soft very high state' or 'steep power-law' state. Softer X-ray states are not associated with 'core' radio emission. We further demonstrate quantitatively that the transient jets associated with these optically thin events are considerably more relativistic than those in the 'low/hard' X-ray state. This in turn implies that, as the disc makes its collapse inwards, the jet Lorentz factor rapidly increases, resulting in an internal shock in the outflow, which is the cause of the observed optically thin radio emission. We provide simple estimates for the efficiency of such a shock in the collision of a fast jet with a previously generated outflow that is only mildly relativistic. In addition, we estimate the jet power for a number of such transient events as a function of X-ray luminosity, and find them to be comparable to an extrapolation of the functions estimated for the 'low/hard' state jets. The normalization may be larger, however, which may suggest a contribution from some other power source such as black hole spin, for the transient jets. Finally, we attempt to fit these results together into a coherent semiquantitative model for the disc-jet coupling in all black hole X-ray binary systems.},

abstract = {Capella is the brightest chromospherically active binary in the sky, hosting a cooler G8III giant (Aa) and a hotter G1III companion (Ab). The source has been extensively observed in the X-rays in the past decades not only for its astrophysical interest in the field of corona sources, but also for in-flight calibrations of space-based X-ray instruments. In 2006, it was demonstrated using Chandra/High Energy Transmission Grating (HETG) observations that Aa is the main contributor to Capella's X-ray emission, as the centroid energies of the emission lines are Doppler shifted along the orbit of the G8III giant (an aspect that has to be taken into consideration for calibration activities of X-ray instruments). In this paper, we extend the previous analysis performed in 2006 by re-analysing in a homogeneous way all Chandra/HETG observations performed in the direction of Capella. By doubling the amount of data available, we strengthened the conclusion that Capella Aa is the dominant emitter in soft X-rays. We did not find any evidence of a statistically significant contribution to this emission by the Ab giant. Our findings are discussed also in light of the incoming launch of the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) mission (spring 2023).},

abstract = {The determination of fundamental parameters in low-mass X-ray binaries typically relies on measuring the radial velocity curve of the companion star through optical or near-infrared spectroscopy. It was recently suggested that high resolution X-ray spectroscopy might enable a measurement of the radial velocity curve of the compact object by monitoring the Doppler shifts induced by the orbital motion of the disc wind or the disc atmosphere. We analysed a Chandra-HETG+NuSTAR soft state observation of MXB 1659-298, an eclipsing neutron star low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB). We measured a radial velocity curve whose phase offset and semi-amplitude are consistent with the primary star. We derived the value for the semiamplitude of the radial velocity for the compact object K1 = 89 ± 19 km s-1, constrained the mass of the secondary (0:3≤M2≤0:8 M⊙) and the orbital inclination of the binary system (73≤i≤77°). These values are consistent with previous estimates from independent methods. Via the same technique, the next generation of X-ray observatories equipped with high spectral resolution instruments (e.g., Athena) will have the potential to measure the radial velocity curve of the primary in high inclination X-ray binaries to an accuracy of a few per cent.},

abstract = {The transient black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1803−298 was discovered on 2021 May 1, as it went into outburst from a quiescent state. As the source rose in flux it showed periodic absorption dips and fit the timing and spectral characteristics of a hard-state accreting black hole. We report on the results of a Target-of-Opportunity observation with NuSTAR obtained near the peak outburst flux beginning on 2021 May 13, after the source had transitioned into an intermediate state. MAXI J1803−298 is variable across the observation, which we investigate by extracting spectral and timing products separately for different levels of flux throughout the observation. Our timing analysis reveals two distinct potential quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) which are not harmonically related at 5.4 ± 0.2 Hz and 9.4 ± 0.3 Hz, present only during periods of lower flux. With clear relativistic reflection signatures detected in the source spectrum, we applied several different reflection models to the spectra of MAXI J1803−298. Here we report our results, utilizing high-density reflection models to constrain the disk geometry, and assess changes in the spectrum dependent on the source flux. With a standard broken power-law emissivity, we find a near-maximal spin for the black hole, and we are able to constrain the inclination of the accretion disk at 75° ± 2°, which is expected for a source that has shown periodic absorption dips. We also significantly detect a narrow absorption feature at 6.91 ± 0.06 keV with an equivalent width between 4 and 9 eV, which we interpret as the signature of a disk wind.},

abstract = {We present simultaneous optical and near-infrared spectra obtained during the 2021 outburst of the black hole transient 4U 1543- 47. The X-ray hardness-intensity diagram and the comparison with similar systems reveal a luminous outburst, probably reaching the Eddington luminosity, as well as a long-lasting excursion to the so-called ultra-luminous state. VLT/X-shooter spectra were taken in two epochs 14 days apart during the early and brightest part of the outburst, while the source was in this ultra-luminous accretion state. The data show strong H and He I emission lines, as well as high-excitation He II and O III transitions. Most lines are single-peaked in both spectra, except for the O III lines that exhibit evident double-peaked profiles during the second epoch. The Balmer lines are embedded in broad absorption wings that we believe are mainly produced by the contribution of the A2V donor to the optical flux, which we estimate to be in the range of 11-14% in the r band during our observations. Although no conspicuous outflow features are found, we observe some wind-related line profiles, particularly in the near-infrared. Such lines include broad emission line wings and skewed red profiles, suggesting the presence of a cold (i.e., low ionisation) outflow with similar observational properties to those found in other low-inclination black hole transients.},

abstract = {The Galactic black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 had a bright outburst in 2018 when it became the second brightest X-ray source in the sky. It was too bright for X-ray CCD instruments such as XMM–Newton and Chandra, but was well observed by photon-counting instruments such as Neutron star Inner Composition Explorer (NICER) and Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). We report here on the discovery of an excess-emission component during the soft state. It is best modelled with a blackbody spectrum in addition to the regular disc emission, modelled as either diskbb or kerrbb. Its temperature varies from about 0.9 to 1.1 keV, which is about 30–80 per cent higher than the inner disc temperature of diskbb. Its flux varies between 4 and 12 per cent of the disc flux. Simulations of magnetized accretion discs have predicted the possibility of excess emission associated with a non-zero torque at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) about the black hole, which, from other NuSTAR studies, lies at about 5 gravitational radii or about 60 km (for a black hole, mass is 8 M☉). In this case, the emitting region at the ISCO has a width varying between 1.3 and 4.6 km and would encompass the start of the plunge region where matter begins to fall freely into the black hole.},

@article{Koljonen2023_MAXIJ1820+070_optical_modeling_wind_atmospheres_thermal,
abstract = {The optical emission line spectra of X-ray binaries (XRBs) are thought to be produced in an irradiated atmosphere, possibly the base of a wind, located above the outer accretion disc. However, the physical nature of - and physical conditions in - the line-forming region remain poorly understood. Here, we test the idea that the optical spectrum is formed in the transition region between the cool, geometrically thin part of the disc near the mid-plane and a hot, vertically extended atmosphere or outflow produced by X-ray irradiation. We first present a VLT X-Shooter spectrum of XRB MAXI J1820+070 in the soft state associated with its 2018 outburst, which displays a rich set of double-peaked hydrogen and helium recombination lines. Aided by ancillary X-ray spectra and reddening estimates, we then model this spectrum with the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code Python, using a simple biconical disc wind model inspired by radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of irradiation-driven outflows from XRB discs. Such a model can qualitatively reproduce the observed features; nearly all of the optical emission arising from the transonic 'transition region' near the base of the wind. In this region, characteristic electron densities are on the order of 10$^{12-13}$ cm$^{-3}$, in line with the observed flat Balmer decrement (H$\alpha$/H$\beta \approx 1.3$). We conclude that strong irradiation can naturally give rise to both the optical line-forming layer in XRB discs and an overlying outflow/atmosphere that produces X-ray absorption lines.},

@article{Bailyn1995_GROJ1655-40_eclipses,
abstract = {X-RAY novae are binary systems in which a compact object accretes gas from a companion star. In several cases there is good evidence that the compact object is a black hole1–5. The best evidence for the presence of a black hole comes from measuring the orbital velocity of the companion star and thereby determining the minimum mass of the compact object; when this mass exceeds the maximum mass for a neutron star (≲3 solar masses6), a black hole seems the only remaining possibility. The unusual X-ray nova GRO J1655 - 40 (refs 7-10) is unique because it emits superlumi-nal radio jets, suggesting that it is a low-luminosity counterpart to active galactic nuclei7,9, which are thought to be powered by accretion onto a massive black hole. Here we report observations of the optical counterpart10 of GRO J1655 - 40, which show that the system undergoes periodic eclipses; the edge-on geometry thus implied allows a determination of the companion star's true velocity. The mass of the compact object derived from the velocity curve is at least 3.16 ±0.15 solar masses, which strongly supports its identification as a black hole. {\textcopyright} 1995, Nature Publishing Group.

abstract = {In this paper, we use an RXTE library of spectral models from 10 black hole and 9 pulsar X-ray binaries, as well as model spectra available in the literature from 13 extra-galactic ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). We compute average bolometric corrections (BC = Lband/Lbol) for our sample as a function of different accretion rates. We notice the same behaviour between black hole and pulsar BCs only when ULX pulsars are included. These measurements provide a picture of the energetics of the accretion flow for an X-ray binary based solely on its observed luminosity in a given band. Moreover, it can be a powerful tool in X-ray binary population synthesis models. Furthermore, we calculate the X-ray (2-10 keV) to optical (V band) flux ratios originating from the disc/corona at different Eddington ratios for the black hole X-ray binaries in our sample. This provides a metric of the maximum contribution of the disc to the optical emission of a binary system and better constraints on its nature (donor type, etc.). We find that the optical to X-ray flux ratio shows very little variation as a function of accretion rate, but testing for different disc geometry scenarios we find that the optical contribution of the disc increases as the p value decreases [T(r) ∼r-p]. Moreover, observational data are in agreement with a thicker disc scenario (p < 0.65), which could also possibly explain the lack of observed high-inclination systems.},

We find a strong (one-to-one) relation between radio oscillation events and series of spectrally hard states in the X-ray light curves, if the hard states are longer than ∼100s and are 'well separated' from each other. In all other cases the source shows either low-level or high-level radio emission, but no radio oscillation events. During intervals when the source stays in the hard spectral state for periods of days to months, the radio behaviour is quite different; during some of these intervals a quasi-continuous jet is formed with an almost flat synchrotron spectrum extending to at least the near-infrared. Based on the similarities between the oscillation profiles at different wavelengths, we suggest a scenario which can explain most of the complex X-ray:radio behaviour of GRS 1915+105. We compare this behaviour with that of other black hole sources, and challenge previous reports of a relation between spectrally soft X-ray states and the radio emission.},

abstract = {A comprehensive wideband spectral analysis of the brightest black hole X-ray binary 4U $1543-47$ during its 2021 outburst is carried out for the first time using NICER, NuSTAR, and AstroSat observations by phenomenological and reflection modelling. The source attains a super-Eddington peak luminosity and remains in the soft state, with a small fraction ($< 3\%$) of the inverse-Comptonized photons. The spectral modelling reveals a steep photon index ($\Gamma \sim 2-2.6$) and relatively high inner disk temperature ($T_{in}\sim 0.9-1.27$ keV). The line-of-sight column density varies between ($0.45-0.54$)$\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. Reflection modelling using the RELXILL model suggests that 4U $1543-47$ is a low-inclination system ($\theta \sim 32^\circ - 40^\circ$). The accretion disk is highly ionized (log $\xi$ > 3) and has super solar abundance (3.6$-$10 $A_{Fe,\odot}$) over the entire period of study. We detected a prominent dynamic absorption feature between $\sim 8-11$ keV in the spectra throughout the outburst. This detection is the first of its kind for X-ray binaries. We infer that the absorption of the primary X-ray photons by the highly ionized, fast-moving disk-winds can produce the observed absorption feature. The phenomenological spectral modelling also shows the presence of a neutral absorption feature $\sim 7.1 - 7.4$ keV, and both ionized and neutral absorption components follow each other with a delay of a typical viscous timescale of $10-15$ days.},

@article{Piconcelli2004_SNR_opti,
abstract = {We present a XMM-Newton observation of Markarian 304, a Seyfert 1 galaxy at z = 0.066. The EPIC data show that MKN 304 is affected by heavy (NH ≈ 1023 cm-2) obscuration arising from ionized gas. A two-phase warm absorber provides an adequate parametrization of this gas. The ionization parameter of the two components is $\xi$ ≈ 6 erg cm-2 s-1 and $\Gamma$ ≈ 90 erg cm-2 s-1, respectively. The observed continuum photon index (≈ 1.9) is typical for Seyfert 1 galaxies. Two significant emission lines are detected at 0.57 keV and 6.4 keV, respectively. The former is mostly likely due to He-like oxygen triplet emission arising from an ionized plasma (maybe the warm absorber itself). The latter is due to fluorescent emission of K-shell iron in a low-ionization state (Fe I-XV). The upper limit for the line width of $\sigma$ K$\alpha$ < 0.18 keV most likely rules out an origin in the inner parts of the accretion disc. Interestingly, the strength of such line is consistent with the possibility that the emission is produced in the warm absorber itself. However, a substantial contribution from the torus is plausible too. We have also found a weak (4 per cent of the primary continuum) soft excess emission component. The presence of this excess could be explained by either emission/scattering from a warm gas or partial covering, or a combination of them.},

The data obtained by ASM are supplemented by data from the ESO 1-m Schmidt and the 1.54-m Danish telescopes, showing that the X-ray spectrum of the GS 1354 - 64 consists of two components: a disk blackbody spectrum with a temperature of 0.7 keV and a power-law component with a photon index of 2.1, which is one of the characteristics of the black hole candidates. It is shown that, although the position of the GS 1354 - 64 source is consistent with the positions of two X-ray outbursts, MX 1353 - 64 and Cen X-2, the characteristics of GS 1354 - 64 are markedly different from either of these sources.},

Strong ionized Fe Ka and K$\beta$ absorption lines are always observed during the soft state, whereas they disappear during the hard state. We computed photoionization stability curves for the hard and the soft states, under different assumptions on the adopted spectral energy distributions and the physical parameters of the plasma. We observe that the ionized absorber always lies on a stable branch of the photoionization stability curve during the soft state, while it becomes unstable during the hard state. This suggests that photoionization instability plays a key role in defining the observable properties of the ionized absorber. The same process might explain the disappearance of the high ionization absorber/wind during the hard state in other accreting neutron stars and black holes.},

@article{Marcel2019_JED-SAD_IV,
abstract = {Context. Transient X-ray binaries (XrB) exhibit very different spectral shapes during their evolution. In luminosity-color diagrams, their behavior in X-rays forms q-shaped cycles that remain unexplained. In Paper I, we proposed a framework where the innermost regions of the accretion disk evolve as a response to variations imposed in the outer regions. These variations lead not only to modifications of the inner disk accretion rate {\'{a}}in, but also to the evolution of the transition radius rJ between two disk regions. The outermost region is a standard accretion disk (SAD), whereas the innermost region is a jet-emitting disk (JED) where all the disk angular momentum is carried away vertically by two self-confined jets. Aims. In the previous papers of this series, it has been shown that such a JED-SAD disk configuration could reproduce the typical spectral (radio and X-rays) properties of the five canonical XrB states. The aim of this paper is now to replicate all X-ray spectra and radio emission observed during the 2010-2011 outburst of the archetypal object GX 339-4. Methods. We used the two-Temperature plasma code presented in two previous papers (Papers II and III) and designed an automatic ad hoc fitting procedure that for any given date calculates the required disk parameters ({\'{a}}in,rJ) that fit the observed X-ray spectrum best. We used X-ray data in the 3-40 keV (RXTE/PCA) spread over 438 days of the outburst, together with 35 radio observations at 9 GHz (ATCA) dispersed within the same cycle. Results. We obtain the time distributions of {\'{a}}in(t) and rJ(t) that uniquely reproduce the X-ray luminosity and the spectral shape of the whole cycle. In the classical self-Absorbed jet synchrotron emission model, the JED-SAD configuration also reproduces the radio properties very satisfactorily, in particular, the switch-off and-on events and the radio-X-ray correlation. Although the model is simplistic and some parts of the evolution still need to be refined, this is to our knowledge the first time that an outburst cycle is reproduced with such a high level of detail. Conclusions. Within the JED-SAD framework, radio and X-rays are so intimately linked that radio emission can be used to constrain the underlying disk configuration, in particular, during faint hard states. If this result is confirmed using other outbursts from GX 339-4 or other X-ray binaries, then radio could be indeed used as another means to indirectly probe disk physics.},

@article{Marcel2020_JED-SAD_V,
abstract = {Context. We proposed in paper I that the spectral evolution of transient X-ray binaries (XrB) is due to an interplay between two flows: a standard accretion disk (SAD) in the outer parts and a jet-emitting disk (JED) in the inner parts. We showed in papers II, III, and IV that the spectral evolution in X-ray and radio during the 2010-2011 outburst of GX 339-4 can be recovered. However, the observed variability in X-ray was never addressed in this framework. Aims. We investigate the presence of low frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs) during an X-ray outburst, and address the possible correlation between the frequencies of these LFQPOs and the transition radius between the two flows, rJ. Methods. We select X-ray and radio data that correspond to 3 outbursts of GX 339-4. We use the method detailed in Paper IV to obtain the best parameters rJ(t) and ṁ in(t) for each outburst. We also independently search for X-ray QPOs in each selected spectra and compare the QPO frequency to the Kepler and epicyclic frequencies of the flow in rJ. Results. We successfully reproduce the correlated evolution of the X-ray spectra and the radio emission for 3 different activity cycles of GX 339-4. We use a unique normalisation factor for the radio emission, f ∼ R. We also report the detection of 7 new LFQPOs (3 Type B, and 4 Type C), to go along with the ones previously reported in the literature. We show that the frequency of Type C QPOs can be linked to the dynamical JED-SAD transition radius rJ, rather than to the optically thin-thick transition radius in the disk. The scaling factor q such that $\nu$QPO $\nu$K(rJ)/q is q 70 - 130, a factor consistent during the 4 cycles, and similar to previous studies. Conclusions. The JED-SAD hybrid disk configuration not only provides a successful paradigm allowing us to describe XrB cycles, but also matches the evolution of QPO frequencies. Type C QPOs provide an indirect way to probe the JED-SAD transition radius, where an undetermined process produces secular variability. The demonstrated relation between the transition radius links Type C QPOs to the transition between two different flows, effectively tying it to the inner magnetized structure, i.e., the jets. This direct connection between the jets (accretion-ejection) structure and the process responsible for Type C QPOs, if confirmed, could naturally explain their puzzling multi-wavelength behavior.},

@article{Petrucci2010_JED_XRB,
abstract = {Context. Interpretation of the X-ray spectra of X-ray binaries during their hard states requires a hot, optically thin medium. There are several accretion disc models that account for this aspect. However, none is designed to simultaneously explain powerful jets detected during these states. Aims. A new quasi-Keplerian hot accretion disc solution, a jet emitting disc (JED hereafter), which is part of a global disc-jet MHD structure producing stationary super-alfv{\'{e}}nic ejection, is investigated here. Its radiative and energetic properties are then compared to the observational constraints found in Cygnus X-1. Methods. We solve the disc energy equation by balancing the local heating term with advection and cooling by synchrotron, bremsstrahlung, and Comptonization processes. The heating term, disc density, accretion velocity, and magnetic field amplitude were taken from published self-similar models of accretion-ejection structures. Both optically thin and thick regimes are considered in a one-temperature, gas-supported disc. Results. Three branches of solutions are found to be possible at a given radius, but we only investigate the hot, optically thin and geometrically slim solutions. These solutions give simultaneously and consistently the radiative and energetics properties of the disc-jet system. They are able to reproduce the global accretion-ejection properties of Cygnus X-1 very well, namely its X-ray spectral emission, jet power, and jet velocity. About half of the released accretion power is used to produce two mildly relativistic (v/c\simeq 0.5) jets, and for a luminosity of about 1\% of the Eddington luminosity, the JED temperature and optical depth are close to what is observed in the hard state of Cygnus X-1. Conclusions. The accretion and ejection properties of JEDs agree with the observations of the prototypical black hole binary Cygnus X-1. The JED solutions are likely to be relevant to the whole class of microquasars. {\textcopyright} 2010 ESO.},

@article{Ohsuga2009_MHD_disk_jet_simu,
abstract = {Black-hole accretion systems are known to possess several distinct modes (or spectral states), such as low/hard state and high/soft state. Since the dynamics of the corresponding flows is distinct, theoretical models were sepa-rately considered for each state. We here propose a unified model based on our new, global, two-dimensional radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations. By controlling a density normalization we could for the first time reproduce three distinct modes of accretion flow and outflow with one numerical code. When the density is large (model A), a geometrically thick, very luminous disk forms, in which photon trapping takes place. When the density is moderate (model B), the accreting gas can effectively be cooled by emitting radiation, thus generating a thin disk, i.e., a soft-state disk. When the density is too low for radiative cooling to be important (model C), a disk becomes hot, thick, and faint; i.e., a hard-state disk. The magnetic energy is amplified within the disk up to about twice, 30\%, and 20\% of the gas energy in models A, B, and C, respectively. Notably, the disk outflows with helical magnetic fields, which are driven either by radiation-pressure force or magnetic-pressure force, are ubiquitous in any accretion modes. Finally, our simulations are consistent with the phenomenological a-viscosity prescription; that is, the disk viscosity is proportional to the pressure. {\textcopyright} 2009.

@article{Proga2003_wind_simulation_mhd_thermal,
abstract = {We study the two-dimensional, time-dependent MHD of radiation-driven winds from luminous accretion disks initially threaded by a purely axial magnetic field. The radiation force is mediated primarily by spectral lines. We use ideal MHD to compute the evolution of Keplerian disks, varying the magnetic field strengths and the luminosity of the disk, the central accreting object or both. We find that the magnetic fields very quickly start deviating from purely axial due to the magnetorotational instability. This leads to fast growth of the toroidal magnetic field. As a result the toroidal field dominates over the poloidal field above the disk and the gradient of the former drives a slow and dense disk outflow, which conserves specific angular momentum. Depending on the strength of the magnetic field relative to the system luminosity the disk wind can be radiation- or MHD driven. The pure radiation-driven wind consists of a dense, slow outflow that is bounded on the polar side by a high-velocity stream. The mass-loss rate is mostly due to the fast stream. As the magnetic field strength increases first the slow part of the flow is affected, namely it becomes denser and slightly faster and begins to dominate the mass-loss rate. In very strong magnetic field or pure MHD cases, the wind consists of only a dense, slow outflow without the presence of the distinctive fast stream so typical to pure radiation-driven winds. Our simulations indicate that winds launched by the magnetic fields are likely to remain dominated by the fields downstream because of their relatively high densities.},

@article{Chakravorty2023_MHD_wind_prefictions_Athena_XRISM,
abstract = {In our self-similar, analytical, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) accretion–ejection solution, the density at the base of the outflow is explicitly dependent on the disc accretion rate – a unique property of this class of solutions. We had earlier found that the ejection index $p \gt \sim 0.1 (\dot{M}_{\rm{acc}} \propto r^p)$ is a key MHD parameter that decides if the flow can cause absorption lines in the high resolution X-ray spectra of black hole binaries. Here, we choose three dense warm solutions with p = 0.1, 0.3, 0.45 and carefully develop a methodology to generate spectra which are convolved with the Athena and XRISM response functions to predict what they will observe seeing through such MHD outflows. In this paper two other external parameters were varied – extent of the disc, $\rm {r_o|_{\rm{max}}} = 10^5, \, 10^6 \, \, \rm {r_G}$, and the angle of the line of sight, i ∼ 10–25°. Resultant absorption lines (H and He-like Fe, Ca, Ar) change in strength and their profiles manifest varying degrees of asymmetry. We checked if (a) the lines and (ii) the line asymmetries are detected, in our suit of synthetic Athena and XRISM spectra. Our analysis shows that Athena should detect the lines and their asymmetries for a standard 100 ks observation of a 100 mCrab source – lines with equivalent width as low as a few eV should be detected if the 6–8 keV counts are larger than 104–105 even for the least favourable simulated cases.},

@article{Jacquemin-Ide2021_wind_MHD_simulation,
abstract = {Context. Astrophysical disks are likely embedded in an ambient vertical magnetic field generated by its environment. This ambient field is known to drive magneto-rotational turbulence in the disk bulk, but it is also responsible for launching magnetised outflows at the origin of astrophysical jets. Yet, the interplay between turbulence and outflows is not understood. In particular, the vertical structure and long-term (secular) evolution of such a system lack quantitative predictions. It is, nevertheless, this secular evolution which is proposed to explain time variability in many accreting systems such as FuOr, X-ray binaries, and novae like systems. Aims. We seek to constraint the structure and long-term evolution of turbulent astrophysical disks subject to magnetised outflows in the non-relativistic regime. More specifically we aim to characterise the mechanism driving accretion, the dynamics of the disk atmosphere, the role played by the outflow, and the long-term evolution of mass and magnetic flux distributions. Methods. We computed and analysed global 3D ideal magnetohydrynamic (MHD) simulations of an accretion disk threaded by a large-scale magnetic field. We measured the turbulent state of the system by Reynolds averaging the ideal MHD equations and evaluate the role of the turbulent terms in the equilibrium of the system. We then computed the transport of mass, angular momentum, and magnetic fields in the disk to characterise its secular evolution. Finally, we performed a parameter exploration survey in order to characterise how the transport properties depend on the disk properties. Results. We find that weakly magnetised disks drive jets that carry a small fraction of the disk angular momentum away. The mass-weighted accretion speed remains subsonic, although there is always an upper turbulent atmospheric region where transsonic accretion takes place. We show that this turbulence is driven by a strongly magnetised version of the magneto-rotational instability. The internal disk structure therefore appears drastically different from the conventional hydrostatic picture. We expect that the turbulent atmosphere region will lead to non-thermal features in the emission spectra from compact objects. In addition, we show that the disk is subject to a secular viscous-type instability, which leads to the formation of long-lived ring-like structures in the disk surface density distribution. This instability is likely connected to the magnetic field transport. Finally, we show that for all of the parameters explored, the ambient magnetic field is always dragged inward in the disk at a velocity which increases with the disk magnetisation. Beyond a threshold on the latter, the disk undergoes a profound radial readjustment. It leads to the formation of an inner accretion-ejection region with a supersonic mass-weighted accretion speed and where the magnetic field distribution becomes steady and reaches a magnitude near equipartition with the thermal pressure. This inner structure shares many properties with the jet emitting disk model. Overall, these results pave the way for quantitative self-consistent secular disk models.},

Using the XSTAR photoionization code, we calculate heating and cooling rates as a function of gas photoionization parameter and temperature for several examples of SEDs: bremsstrahlung, blackbody, hard and soft state XRBs, Type 1 and Type 2 AGN. As an application of our method, we study the hydrodynamics of 1D spherical winds heated by a uniform radiation field using the code ATHENA++. We find that in all cases explored a wind settles into a transonic, steady state. The wind evolves along the radiative heating equilibrium curve until adiabatic cooling effects become important and the flow departs from radiative equilibrium. If the flow is heated very rapidly, for example as in a thermally unstable regime, the corresponding column density of gas is low. Perhaps one of the most intriguing results of our work is the two-stage acceleration of the wind that happens when there are two thermally unstable regions and the flux is relatively high. The efficiency with which the radiation field transfers energy to the wind is dependent on the SED of the external source, particularly the relative flux of soft X-rays. These results suggest that detailed photoionization calculations are essential not only to predict spectra but also to properly capture the flow dynamics.},

@article{Higginbottom2015_wind_thermal_XRB_new,
abstract = {X-ray and UV line emission in X-ray binaries (XRBs) can be accounted for by a hot corona. Such a corona forms through irradiation of the outer disk by radiation produced in the inner accretion flow. The same irradiation can produce a strong outflow from the disk at sufficiently large radii. Outflowing gas has been recently detected in several XRBs via blueshifted absorption lines. However, the causal connection between winds produced by irradiation and the blueshifted absorption lines is problematic, particularly in the case of GRO J1655-40. Observations of this source imply wind densities about two orders of magnitude higher than theoretically predicted. This discrepancy does not mean that these "thermal disk winds" cannot explain blueshifted absorption in other systems, nor that they are unimportant as a sink of matter. Motivated by the inevitability of thermal disk winds and wealth of data taken with current observatories such as Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Suzaku, as well as the future AstroH mission, we decided to investigate the requirements to produce very dense winds. Using physical arguments, hydrodynamical simulations, and absorption-line calculations, we found that modification of the heating and cooling rates by a factor of a few results in an increase of the wind density of up to an order of magnitude and the wind velocity by a factor of about two. Therefore, the mass-loss rate from the disk can be one, if not even two, orders of magnitude higher than the accretion rate onto the central object. Such a high mass-loss rate is expected to destabilize the disk and perhaps provides a mechanism for state change.},

@article{Ferreira1997_MHW_wind,
abstract = {Non-relativistic, magnetically-driven jets are constructed by taking self-consistently into account the feedback on the underlying accretion disc. It is shown that such jets are mostly described by the ejection index $\xi$ = d ln Ma/d ln r, which is a local measure of the disc ejection efficiency. This parameter is found to lie in a very narrow range, due to constraints imposed by both the disc vertical equilibrium and the steady transfer of angular momentum. The investigation of global disc-jets solutions provided two important results. First, it shows that the disc vertical equilibrium imposes a minimum mass flux ejected. Thus, one cannot construct jet models with arbitrarily small mass loads. Second, their asymptotic behaviour critically depends on a fastness parameter $\omega$A = $\Omega$*rA/VAP,A, ratio of the field lines rotation velocity to the poloidal Alfv{\'{e}}n velocity at the Alfv{\'{e}}n surface. This parameter must be bigger than, but of the order of, unity. Self-similar jets from Keplerian discs, after widening up to a maximum radius whose value increases with $\omega$A, always recollimate towards the jet axis, until the fast-magnetosonic critical point is reached. It is doubtful that such solutions could steadily cross this last point, the jet either ending there or rebouncing. Recollimation takes place because of the increasing effect of magnetic constriction. This systematic behaviour is due to the large opening of the magnetic surfaces, leading to such an efficient acceleration that matter always reaches its maximum poloidal velocity. This "over-widening" stems from having the same ejection efficiency $\xi$ in the whole jet. Realistic jets, fed with ejection indices varying from one magnetic surface to the other, would not undergo recollimation, allowing either cylindrical or parabolic asymptotic collimation. The study of such jets requires full 2-D numerical simulations, with proper boundary conditions at the disc surface.},

@article{Konigl1994_MHD_win_AGNs,
abstract = {Centrifugally driven winds from the surfaces of magnetized accretion disks have been recognized as an attractive mechanism of removing the angular momentum of the accreted matter and of producing the bipolar outflows and jets that are often associated with compact astronomical objects. As previously suggested in the context of young stellar objects, such winds have unique observational manifestations stemming from their highly stratified density and velocity structure and from their exposure to the strong continuum radiation field of the compact object. We have applied this scenario to active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and investigated the properties of hydromagnetic outflows that originate within ∼10M8 pc of the central 108M8 M⊙ black hole. On the basis of our results, we propose that hydromagnetic disk-driven winds may underlie the classification of broad-line and narrow-line AGNs (e.g., the Seyfert 1/Seyfert 2 dichotomy) as well as the apparent dearth of luminous Seyfert 2 galaxies. More generally, we demonstrate that such winds could strongly influence the spectral characteristics of Seyfert galaxies, QSOs, and BL Lac objects (BLOs). According to the Seyfert unification scheme, Seyfert 2 galaxies represent Seyfert 1 galaxies that are obscured by a dusty torus. Analogous schemes have been proposed for relating narrow-line radio galaxies to broad-line radio galaxies and radio-loud QSOs, and luminous QSOs to ultraluminous infrared galaxies. In our picture, the torus is identified with the outer regions of the wind where dust uplifted from the disk surfaces by gasgrain collisions is embedded in the outflow. Using an efficient radiative transfer code, we show that the infrared emission of Seyfert galaxies and QSOs can be attributed to the reprocessing of the UV/soft X-ray AGN continuum by the dust in the wind and the disk. We demonstrate that the radiation pressure force flattens the dust distribution in objects with comparatively high (but possibly sub-Eddington) bolometric luminosities, and we propose this as one likely reason for the apparent paucity of narrow-line objects among certain highluminosity AGNs. Using the XSTAR photoionization code, we show that the inner regions of the wind could naturally account for the warm (≳ 105 K) and hot (≳ 106 K) gas components that have been inferred to exist on scales ≳ 102 pc in several Seyfert galaxies. We suggest that the partially ionized gas in the inner regions of the wind, rather than the dusty, neutral outflow that originates further out in the disk, could account for the bulk of the X-ray absorption in Seyferts observed at relatively small angles to their symmetry axes. Electron scattering by this gas might give rise to the "ionization cones" that have been detected in objects like NGC 1068 (with a corresponding focusing of the X-ray emission possibly contributing to the apparent deficit of X-ray-luminous Seyfert 2 galaxies), and it could also be responsible for some of the continuum optical polarization characteristics of Seyfert galaxies and radio-quiet QSOs. Other observed optical and infrared polarization properties of these AGNs may be attributed to the effects of dust scattering and transmission in the outer zones of the wind. Finally, we discuss the application of this model to the interpretation of the ∼0.6 keV X-ray absorption feature reported in several BLOs.},

abstract = {We present the two-dimensional ionization structure of self-similar magnetohydrodynamic winds off accretion disks around and irradiated by a central X-ray point source. On the basis of earlier observational clues and theoretical arguments, we focus our attention on a subset of these winds, namely those with radial density dependence n(r) 1/r (r is the spherical radial coordinate). We employ the photoionization code XSTAR to compute the ionic abundances of a large number of ions of different elements and then compile their line-of-sight (LOS) absorption columns. We focus our attention on the distribution of the column density of the various ions as a function of the ionization parameter $\xi$ (or equivalently r) and the angle $\theta$. Particular attention is paid to the absorption measure distribution (AMD), namely their hydrogen-equivalent column per logarithmic $\xi$ interval, dN H/dlog $\xi$, which provides a measure of the winds' radial density profiles. For the chosen density profile n(r) 1/r, the AMD is found to be independent of $\xi$, in good agreement with its behavior inferred from the X-ray spectra of several active galactic nuclei (AGNs). For the specific wind structure and X-ray spectrum, we also compute detailed absorption line profiles for a number of ions to obtain their LOS velocities, v 100-300 km s-1 (at log $\xi$ 2-3) for Fe XVII and v 1000-4000 km s-1 (at log $\xi$ 4-5) for Fe XXV, in good agreement with the observation. Our models describe the X-ray absorption properties of these winds with only two parameters, namely the mass-accretion rate and the LOS angle $\theta$. The probability of obscuration of the X-ray ionizing source in these winds decreases with increasing and increases steeply with the LOS inclination angle $\theta$. As such, we concur with previous authors that these wind configurations, viewed globally, incorporate all the requisite properties of the parsec scale "torii" invoked in AGN unification schemes. We indicate that a combination of the AMD and absorption line profile observations can uniquely determine these model parameters and their bearing on AGN population demographics. {\textcopyright} 2010.

@article{Proga2002_wind_line_driving_issue_XRB,
abstract = {X-ray heating of the photosphere of an accretion disk is a possible mechanism to produce strong, broad UV emission lines in low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). However, detailed photoionization calculations show that this mechanism fails to produce sufficient emission measure. We present the results of hydrodynamical calculations of the disk photosphere irradiated by strong X-rays. We attempt to determine whether LMXBs can harbor significant UV-driven disk winds despite the effects of X-ray ionization. Such winds would be a likely candidate for the site of emission of UV lines and may better explain the observations than the X-ray heated disk photosphere. We find that the local disk radiation cannot launch a wind from the disk because of strong ionizing radiation from the central object. Unphysically high X-ray opacities would be required to shield the UV emitting disk and allow the line force to drive a disk wind. However the same X-ray radiation that inhibits line driving heats the disk and can produce a hot bipolar wind or corona above the disk. To assess the impact of X-ray heating upon driving of a disk wind by the line force in any system with an accretion disk we derive analytic formulae. In particular, we compare results of line-driven disk wind models for accretion disks in LMXBs and active galactic nuclei. The latter show spectral features associated with a strong and fast disk wind. The key parameter determining the role of the line force is not merely the presence of the luminous UV zone in the disk and the presence of the X-rays, but also the distance of this UV zone from the center.},

@article{Zhu2018_wind_simulation_MHD,
abstract = {We report new global ideal MHD simulations for thin accretion disks (with thermal scale height H/R=0.1 and 0.05) threaded by net vertical magnetic fields. Our computations span three orders of magnitude in radius, extend all the way to the pole, and are evolved for more than one viscous time over the inner decade in radius. Static mesh refinement is used to properly resolve MRI. We find that:(1) inward accretion occurs mostly in the upper magnetically dominated regions of the disk, similar to the predictions from some previous analytical work and the "coronal accretion" in previous GRMHD simulations. Rapid inflow in the upper layers combined with slow outflow at the midplane creates strong $R\phi$ and $z\phi$ stresses in the mean field; the vertically integrated $\alpha\sim 0.5-1$ when the initial field has $\beta_{0}=10^3$ at the midplane. (2) A quasi-static global field geometry is established in which flux transport by inflows at the surface is balanced by turbulent diffusion. The field is strongly pinched inwards at the surface. A steady-state advection-diffusion model, with turbulent magnetic Prandtl number of order unity, reproduces this geometry well. (3) Weak unsteady disk winds are launched at $z/R\sim1$ with the Alfven radius $R_{A}/R_{0}\sim3$. Although the wind is episodic, the time averaged properties are well described by steady wind theory. Wind is not efficient at transporting angular momentum. Even with $\beta_{0}=10^3$, only 5\% of the angular momentum transport is driven by torque from the wind, and the wind mass flux from the inner decade of radius is only $\sim$ 0.4\% of the mass accretion rate. With weaker fields or thinner disks, the wind contributes even less. (4) Most of the disk accretion is driven by the $R\phi$ stress from the MRI and global magnetic fields. Our simulations have many applications to astrophysical accretion disk systems.},

@article{Chakravorty2013_thermal_stability,
abstract = {We present a systematic theory-motivated study of the thermodynamic stability condition as an explanation for the observed accretion disc wind signatures in different states of low-mass black hole binaries (BHB). The variability in observed ions is conventionally explained either by variations in the driving mechanisms or by the changes in the ionizing flux or due to density effects, whilst thermodynamic stability considerations have been largely ignored. It would appear that the observability of particular ions in different BHB states can be accounted for through simple thermodynamic considerations in the static limit. Our calculations predict that in the disc-dominated soft thermal and intermediate states, the wind should be thermo-dynamically stable and hence observable. On the other hand, in the power-law-dominated spectrally hard state the wind is found to be thermodynamically unstable for a certain range of 3.55 ≤ log $\xi$ ≤ 4.20. In the spectrally hard state, a large number of the He-like and H-like ions (including e.g. Fe XXV, Ar XVIII and S XV) have peak ion fractions in the unstable ionization parameter ($\xi$) range, making these ions undetectable. Our theoretical predictions have clear corroboration in the literature reporting differences in wind ion observability as the BHBs transition through the accretion states While this effect may not be the only one responsible for the observed gradient in the wind properties as a function of the accretion state in BHBs, it is clear that its inclusion in the calculations is crucial for understanding the link between the environment of the compact object and its accretion processes.},

In our models, the density at the base of the outflow from the accretion disk is not a free parameter but is determined by solving the full set of dynamical MHD equations without neglecting any physical term. Different MHD solutions were generated for different values of (a) the disk aspect ratio (e) and (b) the ejection efficiency (p). We generated two kinds of MHD solutions depending on the absence (cold solution) or presence (warm solution) of heating at the disk surface. The cold MHD solutions are found to be inadequate to account for winds due to their low ejection efficiency. The warm solutions can have sufficiently high values of p (0.1) which is required to explain the observed physical quantities in the wind. The heating (required at the disk surface for the warm solutions) could be due to the illumination which would be more efficient in the Soft state. We found that in the Hard state a range of ionisation parameter is thermodynamically unstable, which makes it impossible to have any wind at all, in the Hard state.

@article{Petrucci2021_outburst_wind_stability,
abstract = {Blueshifted X-ray absorption lines (preferentially from Fe XXV and Fe XXVI present in the 6-8 keV range) indicating the presence of massive hot disk winds in black hole (BH) X-ray binaries (XrB) are most generally observed during soft states. It has been recently suggested that the nondetection of such hot wind signatures in hard states could be due to the thermal instability of the wind in the ionization domain consistent with Fe XXV and Fe XXVI. Studying the wind thermal stability does require, however, a very good knowledge of the spectral shape of the ionizing spectral energy distribution (SED). In this paper, we discuss the expected evolution of the disk wind properties during an entire outburst by using the RXTE observations of GX 339-4 during its 2010-2011 outburst. While GX 339-4 never showed signatures of a hot wind in the X-rays, the dataset used is optimal for the analysis shown in this study. We computed the corresponding stability curves of the wind using the SED obtained with the jet-emitting disk model. We show that the disk wind can transit from stable to unstable states for Fe XXV and Fe XXVI ions on a day timescale. While the absence of wind absorption features in hard states could be explained by this instability, their presence in soft states seems to require changes in the wind properties (e.g., density) during the spectral transitions between hard and soft states. We propose that these changes could be partly due to the variation of the heating power release at the accretion disk surface through irradiation by the central X-ray source. The evolution of the disk wind properties discussed in this paper could be confirmed through the daily monitoring of the spectral transition of a high-inclination BH XrB.},

@article{Rahoui2014_GX339-4_wind_visible_soft_hard,
abstract = {As a complement to our optical and near-infrared study of the continuum properties of GX 339-4 in the two hard and one soft state observations made by the ESO/Very Large Telescope (VLT), FOcal Reducer and Spectrograph #2 (FORS2) and infrared spectrometer and array camera (ISAAC) in early 2010, we report here on the results of our spectral line analysis for the same observations. In the soft state, the presence of strong Balmer, Paschen and Brackett emission lines points to the optical and near-infrared spectra stemming from the irradiated chromosphere of the optically thick and geometrically thin accretion disc. Most of these HI features are still detected in emission in both hard states but are veiled by the compact jets continuum. We also confirm the presence of a broad H$\beta$ absorption feature, prominent in the soft state and shallower in the first hard state, which we argue forms in the deep layers of the optically thick accretion disc. However, this trough is absent in the second hard state, a likely consequence of the formation of a geometrically thick extended envelope that arises above the disc plane and eventually enshrouds the region where the H$\beta$ absorption feature forms. We detect this envelope through the presence of a broad Pa$\beta$ emission line, which is constant during the first hard state but correlates with the underlying continuum during the second hard state, pointing to changing physical properties. We consider that this behaviour may be consistent with the launch of a thermally driven accretion disc wind during the second hard state. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

abstract = {The black hole transient MAXI J1820+070 displayed optical P Cyg profiles and other wind-related emission line features during the hard state of its discovery outburst. We present near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy covering the different accretion states of the system during this event. Our eight-epoch data set (VLT/X-shooter) reveals strong variability in the properties of the NIR emission lines. This includes absorption troughs and extended emission line wings with kinetic properties that are remarkably similar to those inferred from the wind signatures observed in optical emission lines, indicating that they most likely trace the same accretion disc wind. Unlike the optical features, these NIR signatures are not exclusive of the hard state, as they are also witnessed across the soft state with similar observational properties. This supports the presence of a relatively steady outflow during the entire outburst of the system, and it represents the first detection of an accretion disc wind in a black hole soft state at energies other than X-rays. We discuss the visibility of the wind as a function of the spectral band and the potential of NIR spectroscopy for wind studies, in particular during luminous accretion phases.},

abstract = {The advent of the new generation of X-ray telescopes yielded a significant step forward in our understanding of ionised absorption generated in the accretion discs of X-ray binaries. It has become evident that these relatively weak and narrow absorption features, sporadically present in the X-ray spectra of some systems, are actually the signature of equatorial outflows, which might carry away more matter than that being accreted. Therefore, they play a major role in the accretion phenomenon. These outflows (or ionised atmospheres) are ubiquitous during the softer states but absent during the powerlaw dominated, hard states, suggesting a strong link with the state of the inner accretion disc, presence of the radio-jet and the properties of the central source. Here, we discuss the current understanding of this field.},

@article{Woods1996_wind_thermal_init_2,
abstract = {We perform for the first time time-dependent, two-dimensional, axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations using local adaptive mesh refinement of thermally driven rotating winds from X-ray-irradiated accretion disks. The disk is assumed to flare in height with radius allowing direct exposure from the central X-ray source. The heating and cooling are treated strictly in the optically thin approximation. We adopt two spectra characteristic of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) which have Compton temperatures of TIC ≍ 1.3 x 107 K and 108 K. We have computed a number of models which cover a large range in luminosity (0.002 ≤ L/LEddington < 1) and radius (≲20 Compton radii). Our models enable us to extend and improve on the analytic predictions of Begelman, McKee,\& Shields (BMS) for Compton-heated winds by including non-Compton processes such as photoionization heating and line cooling, typical of X-ray-heated winds. These non-Compton processes can be dominant at low temperatures (≲107 K), thus being important in the wind regions of AGNs. Our results agree well with a number of predictions given by BMS, even when non-Compton processes dominate, suggesting that their analytic approximations of the hydrodynamics of disk winds are applicable to the more general area of X-ray-heated winds. In the regime in which Compton processes dominate (i.e., TIC = 108 K spectrum), we have used our results to improve the analytic predictions of BMS, providing a new expression for the mass-loss rate and a modified view of the wind solution topology. We find that beginning from a basically static state, the time-dependent flow which develops eventually settles into a steady wind, without any evidence of hydrodynamic instabilities. The solution topology consists of a corona with an exponentially truncated wind at small radii, and a vigorous wind at large radii which can be impeded by gravity for small luminosities. We have constructed radius-luminosity parameter space plots of our numerical results in analogy to BMS for both the high and low TIC cases, depicting the range of solutions. The plots are strikingly similar to the analytic predictions, especially for high TIC. We find the radial extent of the corona to be independent of luminosity, as predicted by BMS, extending out to about O.25RIC; this is a direct consequence of Compton heating. The transition from an isothermal to nonisothermal corona occurs at a luminosity within about a factor of 2 of the critical luminosity (Lcr ≍ 0.03T-1/2IC8LE) predicted by BMS. The mass flux density in the corona shows an exponential rise, peaking at around O.2RIC nearly independent of luminosity. The wind solutions can be characterized mainly by steadily heated, free winds (region B in BMS) and gravity-inhibited winds (region C in BMS). Nearly isothermal winds with temperatures of the order TIC also exist (region A in BMS) but require higher luminosities than was first estimated by BMS. A necessary condition for the winds to approach isothermality is that the luminosity exceed the critical luminosity. The change in wind solutions from regions B and C is characterized by a nearly discontinuous change in the sonic point location from large heights in region C to small heights in region B. The mass-loss rate, however, appears continuous across this boundary. For a streamline leaving the disk surface at a radius R0, the sonic point distance along the streamline, Ssonic is such that Ssonic/R0 ≍ 0.6 in region B and Ssonic/R0 ≫ 1 in region C. An unexpected conclusion from our numerical results is that the area of a flow tube can actually be smaller at the sonic point than at the disk surface. This is because of the presence of an unbalanced radial pressure gradient of the flow at low heights upon being heated. Incorporating this effect into the simple analytical formulae for the mass-loss rate given by BMS yields results which are typically within about a factor of 2 (3) of our numerical results over a wide range of luminosities and radii for the high (low) Compton temperature models. We provide fitting formulae of our numerical results which give the mass flux density as a function of radius and luminosity. We also discuss briefly the implications of our results for the prediction of Fe K$\alpha$ lines which have recently been observed in AGNs.},

@article{Marcel2018_JED-SAD_III,
abstract = {Context. It has been suggested that the cycles of activity of X-ray binaries (XRB) are triggered by a switch in the dominant disk torque responsible for accretion. As the disk accretion rate increases, the disk innermost regions therefore change from a jet-emitting disk (JED) to a standard accretion disk (SAD). Aims. While JEDs have been proven to successfully reproduce X-ray binary hard states, the existence of an outer cold SAD introduces an extra nonlocal cooling term. We investigate the thermal structure and associated spectra of such a hybrid disk configuration. Methods. We use a two-temperature plasma code, allowing for outside-in computation of the disk local thermal equilibrium with self-consistent advection and optically thin-to-thick transitions in both radiation and gas supported regimes. The nonlocal inverse Compton cooling introduced by the external soft photons is computed by the BELM code. Results. This additional cooling term has a profound influence on JED solutions, allowing a smooth temperature transition from the outer SAD to the inner JED. We explore the full parameter space in disk accretion rate and transition radius, and show that the whole domain in X-ray luminosities and hardness ratios covered by standard XRB cycles is well reproduced by such hybrid disk configurations. Precisely, a reasonable combination of these parameters allows us to reproduce the 3-200 keV spectra of each of five canonical XRB states. Along with these X-ray signatures, JED-SAD configurations also naturally account for the radio emission whenever it is observed. Conclusions. By varying only the radial transition radius and the accretion rate, hybrid disk configurations combining an inner JED and an outer SAD are able to simultaneously reproduce the X-ray spectral states and radio emission of X-ray binaries during their outburst. Adjusting these two parameters, it is then possible to reproduce a full cycle. This will be shown in a forthcoming paper.},

@article{Ferreira2006_JED_paradigm_xrb,
abstract = {We present a new picture for the central regions of Black Hole X-ray Binaries. In our view, these central regions have a multi-flow configuration which consists in (1) an outer standard accretion disc down to a transition radius rJ (2) an inner magnetized accretion disc below rJ driving (3) a non relativistic self-collimated electron-proton jet surrounding, when adequate conditions for pair creation are met; (4) a ultra relativistic electron-positron beam. This accretion-ejection paradigm provides a simple explanation to the canonical spectral states, from radio to X/$\gamma$-rays, by varying the transition radius rJ and disc accretion rate ṁ independently. Large values of rJ correspond to the Quiescent state for low ṁ and the Hard state for larger ṁ. These states are characterized by the presence of a steady electron-proton MHD jet emitted by the disc below rJ. The hard X-ray component is expected to form at the jet basis. When rI becomes smaller than the marginally stable orbit ri, the whole disc resembles a standard accretion disc with no jet, characteristic of the Soft state. Intermediate states correspond to situations where rJ ≳ ri. At large ṁ, an unsteady pair cascade process is triggered within the jet axis, giving birth to flares and ejection of relativistic pair blobs. This would correspond to the luminous intermediate state, sometimes referred to as the Very High state, with its associated superluminal motions. The variation of rJ independently of ṁ is a necessary ingredient in this picture. It arises from the presence of a large scale vertical magnetic field threading the disc. Features such as possible hysteresis and the presence of quasi-periodic oscillations would naturally fit within this new framework. {\textcopyright} ESO 2006.},

abstract = {Black hole accretion flows can be divided into two broad classes: cold and hot. Whereas cold accretion flows consist of cool optically thick gas and are found at relatively high mass accretion rates, hot accretion flows, the topic of this review, are virially hot and optically thin, and occur at lower mass accretion rates. They are described by accretion solutions such as the advection-dominated accretion flow and luminous hot accretion flow. Because of energy advection, the radiative efficiency of these flows is in general lower than that of a standard thin accretion disk. Moreover, the efficiency decreases with decreasing mass accretion rate. Observations show that hot accretion flows are associated with jets. In addition, theoretical arguments suggest that hot flows should produce strong winds. Hot accretion flows are believed to be present in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei and in black hole X-ray binaries in the hard and quiescent states. The prototype is Sgr A, the ultralow-luminosity supermassive black hole at our Galactic center. The jet, wind, and radiation from a supermassive black hole with a hot accretion flow can interact with the external interstellar medium and modify the evolution of the host galaxy.

abstract = {A black hole x-ray binary (XRB) system forms when gas is stripped from a normal star and accretes onto a black hole, which heats the gas sufficiently to emit x-rays. We report a polarimetric observation of the XRB Cygnus X-1 using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer. The electric field position angle aligns with the outflowing jet, indicating that the jet is launched from the inner x-ray–emitting region. The polarization degree is 4.01 ± 0.20\% at 2 to 8 kiloelectronvolts, implying that the accretion disk is viewed closer to edge-on than the binary orbit. These observations reveal that hot x-ray–emitting plasma is spatially extended in a plane perpendicular to, not parallel to, the jet axis. A black hole in a binary system can rip material off of its companion star, which heats up and forms an accretion disk. The disc emits light in the optical and x-ray bands, forming an x-ray binary (XRB) system. Some XRBs also launch a jet of fast-moving material that is visible at radio wavelengths. Krawczynski et al . observed the x-ray polarization of Cygnus X-1, a black hole XRB with a radio jet. By comparing the measured polarization properties with several competing XRB models, they eliminated some hypothesized geometries and determined that the x-ray–emitting region extends parallel to the accretion disc. —KTS x-ray polarization measurements determine the geometric arrangement of hot material accreting onto a black hole.},

abstract = {We present global radiation GRMHD simulations of strongly magnetized accretion onto a spinning, stellar mass black hole at sub-Eddington rates. Using a frequency-dependent Monte Carlo procedure for Compton scattering, we self-consistently evolve a two-temperature description of the ion-electron fluid and its radiation field. For an Eddington ratio $L/L_{\rm Edd} \gtrsim 10^{-3}$, the emergent spectrum forms an apparent power law shape from thermal Comptonization up to a cutoff at $\simeq 100$ keV, characteristic of that seen in the hard spectral states of black hole X-ray binary systems. At these luminosities, the radiative efficiency is high ($\approx 24\%$) and results in a denser midplane region where magnetic fields are dynamically important. For $L/L_{\rm Edd} \sim 10^{-2}$, our hot accretion flow appears to undergo thermal runaway and collapse. Our simulations demonstrate that hot accretion flows can be radiatively efficient and provide an estimate of their maximum luminosity.},

@article{Coriat2009_GX339-4_IRX_correl,
abstract = {GX 339-4 has been one of the key sources for unravelling the accretion ejection coupling in accreting stellar mass black holes. After a long period of quiescence between 1999 and 2002, GX 339-4 underwent a series of four outbursts that have been intensively observed by many ground-based observatories [radio/infrared (IR)/optical] and satellites (X-rays). Here, we present results of these broad-band observational campaigns, focusing on the optical-IR (OIR)/X-ray flux correlations over the four outbursts. We found tight OIR/X-ray correlations over four decades with the presence of a break in the IR/X-ray correlation in the hard state. This correlation is the same for all four outbursts. This can be interpreted in a consistent way by considering a synchrotron self-Compton origin of the X-rays in which the break frequency varies between the optically thick and thin regime of the jet spectrum. We also highlight the similarities and differences between optical/X-ray and IR/X-ray correlations which suggest a jet origin of the near-IR emission in the hard state while the optical is more likely dominated by the blackbody emission of the accretion disc in both hard and soft state. However, we find a non-negligible contribution of 40 per cent of the jet emission in the V band during the hard state. We finally concentrate on a soft-to-hard state transition during the decay of the 2004 outburst by comparing the radio, IR, optical and hard X-rays light curves. It appears that unusual delays between the peak of emission in the different energy domains may provide some important constraints on jet formation scenario. {\textcopyright} 2009 RAS.},

@article{Done2007_BHXRB_accretion,
abstract = {We review how the recent increase in X-ray and radio data from black hole and neutron star binaries can be merged together with theoretical advances to give a coherent picture of the physics of the accretion flow in strong gravity. Both long term X-ray light curves, X-ray spectra, the rapid X-ray variability and the radio jet behaviour are consistent with a model where a standard outer accretion disc is truncated at low luminosities, being replaced by a hot, inner flow which also acts as the launching site of the jet. Decreasing the disc truncation radius leads to softer spectra, as well as higher frequencies (including quasi periodic oscillations, QPOs) in the power spectra, and a faster jet. The collapse of the hot flow when the disc reaches the last stable orbit triggers the dramatic decrease in radio flux, as well as giving a qualitative (and often quantitative) explanation for the major hard-soft spectral transition seen in black holes. The neutron stars are also consistent with the same models, but with an additional component due to their surface, giving implicit evidence for the event horizon in black holes. We review claims of observational data which conflict with this picture, but show that these can also be consistent with the truncated disc model. We also review suggested alternative models for the accretion flow which do not involve a truncated disc. The most successful of these converge on a similar geometry, where there is a transition at some radius larger than the last stable orbit between a standard disc and an inner, jet dominated region, with the X-ray source associated with a mildly relativistic outflow, beamed away from the disc. However, the observed uniformity of properties between black holes at different inclinations suggests that even weak beaming of the X-ray emission may be constrained by the data. After collapse of the hot inner flow, the spectrum in black hole systems can be dominated by the disc emission. Its behaviour is consistent with the existence of a last stable orbit, and such data can be used to estimate the black hole spin. By contrast, these systems can also show very different spectra at these high luminosities, in which the disc spectrum (and probably structure) is strongly distorted by Comptonization. The structure of the accretion flow becomes increasingly uncertain as the luminosity approaches (and exceeds) the Eddington luminosity, though there is growing evidence that winds may play an important role. We stress that these high Eddington fraction flows are key to understanding many disparate and currently very active fields such as ULX, Narrow Line Seyfert 1's, and the growth of the first black holes in the Early Universe. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

@article{Dunn2010_BHXRB_spectral,
abstract = {We report on a consistent and comprehensive spectral analysis of the X-ray emission of 25 black hole X-ray binaries. All publicly available observations of the black hole binaries in the RXTE archive were analysed. Three different types of model were fitted to investigate the spectral changes occurring during an outburst. For the population, as well as for each binary and each outburst from each binary, we construct two diagnostic diagrams. The hardness intensity/luminosity diagram (HID/HLD), the X-ray colour against the flux/luminosity of the binary, is most useful when studying a single binary. However, to compare different binary systems, the disc fraction luminosity diagram (DFLD) is more useful. The DFLD uses the luminosities of the disc and power-law components to calculate the ratio of the disc luminosity to the total luminosity, resulting in a more physical value, which is analogous to the X-ray colour calculated for X-ray binaries. The tracks of the outbursts populate the DFLD more evenly than the HLD. We discuss the limitations of both diagnostic diagrams for the study of the X-ray binary outbursts and clearly illustrate how the two diagrams map on to each other for real outburst data. The similarity of the X-ray colour and disc fraction behaviour over time during an outburst originally seen in GX 339-4 data is seen in other sources' outbursts. We extract the peak luminosities in a single outburst, as well as the luminosities at the transitions away from and returning to the power-law-dominated state for each outburst. The distribution of the luminosities at the transition from the power-law to the disc-dominated state peaks at around 0.3LEdd, the same as the peak of the distribution of the peak luminosities in an outburst. Using the disc fraction to calculate the transition luminosities shows that the distributions of the luminosities for the transitions away from and returning to the power-law-dominated state are both broad and appear to overlap. Using the change in disc fraction to calculate the date when a transition occurred is not drastically different from obtaining the dates from changes in the timing behaviour of the X-ray binary. In addition, we calculate the rate of motion of an X-ray binary through the DFLD during an outburst, a diagnostic which has the potential to be used as a comparison with populations of active galactic nuclei. The fastest rate of motion is on the egress and ingress from the power-law-dominated state. A further region of increased speed through the diagram occurs in the disc-dominated state on the return to the power-law-dominated state. Finally, we compare the measured X-ray luminosities with a small number of contemporaneous radio measurements. Overall, this is the most comprehensive and uniform global study of black hole X-ray binaries to date. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2010 RAS.},

@article{Remillard2006_BHXRB_properties,
abstract = {We review the properties and behavior of 20 X-ray binaries that contain a dynamically-confirmed black hole, 17 of which are transient systems. During the past decade, many of these transient sources were observed daily throughout the course of their typically year-long outburst cycles using the large-area timing detector aboard the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. The evolution of these transient sources is complex. Nevertheless, there are behavior patterns common to all of them as we show in a comprehensive comparison of six selected systems. Central to this comparison are three X-ray states of accretion, which are reviewed and defined quantitatively. We discuss phenomena that arise in strong gravitational fields, including relativistically-broadened Fe lines, high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (100-450 Hz), and relativistic radio and X-ray jets. Such phenomena show us how a black hole interacts with its environment, thereby complementing the picture of black holes that gravitational wave detectors will provide. We sketch a scenario for the potential impact of timing/spectral studies of accreting black holes on physics and discuss a current frontier topic, namely, the measurement of black hole spin.},

@article{Munoz-Darias2014_NSLMXB_BHlike_behavior,
abstract = {We have systematically studied a large sample of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) monitored by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (50 sources; 10000+ observations). We find that the hysteresis patterns between Compton-dominated and thermal-dominated states, typically observed in black hole LMXBs, are also common in neutron star systems. These patterns, which also sample intermediate states, are found when looking at the evolution of both X-ray colour and fast variability of 10 systems accreting below $\sim$30 per cent of the Eddington luminosity (LEdd). We show that hysteresis does not require large changes in luminosity and it is the natural form that state transitions take at these luminosities. At higher accretion rates, neutron stars do not show hysteresis, and they remain in a thermal-dominated, low-variability state, characterized by flaring behaviour and fast colour changes. Only at luminosities close to LEdd, are high variability levels seen again, in correspondence to an increase in the fractional contribution of the Comptonization component. We compare this behaviour with that observed in LMXBs harbouring black holes, showing that the spectral, timing and multiwavelength properties of a given source can be determined by its location in the fast variability-luminosity diagram, which, therefore, provides a common framework for neutron star and black hole accretion states. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

We present here the results of an XMM-Newton target of opportunity observation, performed on 13 March 2006 (44 days after the maximum), and an INTEGRAL observation performed on 15-18 February 2006 (18 days after the maximum). Methods. The EPIC-pn camera on-board XMM-Newton was used in the fast read-out burst mode to avoid photon pile-up, while the RGS was used in spectroscopy high count rate mode. We fit both the XMM-Newton and the INTEGRAL spectra with a two-component model consisting of a thermal accretion disk (represented by diskbb or diskpn models) and a comptonizing hot corona (represented by a power-law or the compTT model). Results. The soft X-ray spectrum is dominated by an accretion disk component, with a maximum temperature decreasing from 0.96±0.04 keV at the time of the INTEGRAL observation to 0.70±0.01 keV on 13 March. The optical monitors on board INTEGRAL and XMM-Newton showed the source with magnitudes V: 11.3-11.4, U:15.0-15.1 and UVW1:14.7-14.8. The soft X-ray spectrum, together with the optical and UV data, show a low hydrogen column density towards the source, and several absorption lines, most likely of interstellar origin, are detected in the RGS spectrum: OIK$\alpha$, OIK$\beta$, OII, OIII and OVII, which trace both cold and hot components of the interstellar medium. The soft X-ray spectrum indicates the presence of a black hole, with an estimate for the upper limit of the mass of 6.0-2.5+4.0 M⊙. {\textcopyright} ESO 2007.},

abstract = {We present optical, X-ray and radio observations of the black hole transient (BHT) XTE J1752-223 towards and in quiescence. Optical photometry shows that the quiescent magnitude of XTE J1752-223 is fainter than 24.4mag in the i′ band. A comparison with measurements of the source during its 2009-2010 outburst shows that the outburst amplitude is more than 8 mag in the i′ band. Known X-ray properties of the source combined with the faintness of the quiescence optical counterpart and the large outburst optical amplitude point towards a short orbital-period system (Porb≲ 6.8h) with an M type (or later) mass donor, at a distance of 3.5 ≲d≲ 8kpc. Simultaneous X-ray and radio data were collected with Chandra and the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA), allowing constraints to be placed on the quiescent X-ray and radio flux of XTE J1752-223. Furthermore, using data covering the final stage of the outburst decay, we investigated the low-luminosity end of the X-ray-radio correlation for this source and compared it with other BHTs. We found that XTE J1752-223 adds to the number of outliers with respect to the 'standard' X-ray-radio luminosity relation. Furthermore, XTE J1752-223 is the second source, after the BHT H1743-322, that shows a transition from the region of the outliers towards the 'standard' correlation at low luminosity. Finally, we report on a faint, variable X-ray source we discovered with Chandra at an angular distance of $\sim$2.9arcsec to XTE J1752-223 and at a position angle consistent with that of the radio jets previously observed from the BHT.

To gain a better understanding of high-energy Galactic sources, we observed the Galactic X-ray binary and black hole candidate XTE J1720-318 in the optical and near-infrared, just after the onset of its X-ray outburst in January, 2003. These observations were obtained with the ESO/NTT as the Target of Opportunity, in February and April 2003. Methods. We performed an accurate astrometry and analysed photometrical and spectroscopic observations. We then produced a colour-magnitude diagram, looked at the overall evolution of the multi-wavelength light curve, and analysed the spectral energy distribution. Results. We discovered the optical counterpart in the R-band (R ∼ 21.5) and confirmed the near-infrared counterpart. We show that, for an absorption between 6 and 8 mag, XTE J1720-318 is likely to be an intermediate mass X-ray binary located at a distance between 3 and 10 kpc, hosting a main sequence star of spectral type between late B and early G. Our second set of observations took place simultaneously with the third secondary outburst present in X-ray and near-infrared light curves. The evolution of its spectral energy distribution shows that XTE J1720-318 entered a transition from a high-soft to a low-hard state in-between the two observations. {\textcopyright} ESO 2006.},

abstract = {Using astrometric VLBI observations, we have determined the parallax of the black hole X-ray binary V404 Cyg to be 0.418 ± 0.024mas, corresponding to a distance of 2.39 ± 0.14kpc, significantly lower than the previously accepted value. This model-independent estimate is the most accurate distance to a Galactic stellar-mass black hole measured to date. With this new distance, we confirm that the source was not super-Eddington during its 1989 outburst. The fitted distance and proper motion imply that the black hole in this system likely formed in a supernova, with the peculiar velocity being consistent with a recoil (Blaauw) kick. The size of the quiescent jets inferred to exist in this system is <1.4AU at 22GHz. Astrometric observations of a larger sample of such systems would provide useful insights into the formation and properties of accreting stellar-mass black holes. {\textcopyright} 2009.

abstract = {We report the results of simultaneous multiwavelength observations of the X-ray transient source SWIFT J1753.5-0127 performed with INTEGRAL, RXTE, NTT, REM and VLA on 2005 August 10-12. The source, which underwent an X-ray outburst since 2005 May 30, was observed during the INTEGRAL Target of Opportunity program dedicated to new X-ray novae located in the Galactic Halo. Broad-band spectra and fast timing variability properties of SWIFT J1753.5-0127 are analyzed together with the optical, near infra-red and radio data. We show that the source was significantly detected up to 600 keV with Comptonization parameters and timing properties typical of the so-called Low/Hard State of black hole candidates. We build a spectral energy distribution and we show that SWIFT J1753.5-0127 does not follow the usual radio/X-ray correlation of X-ray binaries in the Low/Hard State. We give estimates of distance and mass. We conclude that SWIFT J1753.5-0127 belongs to the X-ray nova class and that it is likely a black hole candidate transient source of the Galactic Halo which remained in the Low/Hard State during its main outburst. We discuss our results within the context of Comptonization and jet models.},

abstract = {Swift J1357.2-0933 is a confirmed very faint black hole X-ray transient and has a short estimated orbital period of 2.8 h. We observed Swift J1357.2-0933 for $\sim$50 ks with XMM- Newton in 2013 July during its quiescent state. The source is clearly detected at a 0.5-10 keV unabsorbed flux of $\sim$3 × 10-15 erg cm-2 s-1. If the source is located at a distance of 1.5 kpc (as suggested in the literature), this would imply a luminosity of $\sim$8 × 1029 erg s-1, making it the faintest detected quiescent black hole low-mass X-ray binary. This would also imply that there is no indication of a reversal in the quiescence X-ray luminosity versus orbital period diagram down to 2.8 h, as has been predicted theoretically and recently supported by the detection of the 2.4 h orbital period black hole MAXI J1659-152 at a 0.5-10 keV X-ray luminosity of $\sim$1.2 × 1031 erg s-1. However, there is considerable uncertainty in the distance of Swift J1357.2-0933 and it may be as distant as 6.3 kpc. In this case, its quiescent luminosity would be LX $\sim$ 1.3 × 1031 erg s-1, i.e. similar to MAXI J1659-152 and hence, it would support the existence of such a bifurcation period.We also detected the source in optical at r' $\sim$ 22.3 mag with the Liverpool telescope, simultaneously to our X-ray observation. The X-ray/optical luminosity ratio of Swift J1357.2-0933 agrees with the expected value for a black hole at this range of quiescent X-ray luminosities.},

@article{Chauhan2019_MAXIJ1535-571_d,
abstract = {With the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) we monitored the black hole candidate X-ray binary MAXI J1535--571 over seven epochs from 21 September to 2 October 2017. Using ASKAP observations, we studied the HI absorption spectrum from gas clouds along the line-of-sight and thereby constrained the distance to the source. The maximum negative radial velocities measured from the HI absorption spectra for MAXI J1535--571 and an extragalactic source in the same field of view are $-69\pm4$ km s$^{-1}$ and $-89\pm4$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. This rules out the far kinematic distance ($9.3^{+0.5}_{-0.6}$ kpc), giving a most likely distance of $4.1^{+0.6}_{-0.5}$ kpc, with a strong upper limit of the tangent point at $6.7^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$ kpc. At our preferred distance, the peak unabsorbed luminosity of MAXI J1535--571 was $>78$ per cent of the Eddington luminosity, and shows that the soft-to-hard spectral state transition occurred at the very low luminosity of 1.2 -- 3.4 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ times the Eddington luminosity. Finally, this study highlights the capabilities of new wide-field radio telescopes to probe Galactic transient outbursts, by allowing us to observe both a target source and a background comparison source in a single telescope pointing.},

We derive an extinction of A_V_=14+/-2 from the dust scattering halo, which implies a distance of d$\sim$6-8.5kpc. Thus, GRS 1739-278 radiates at least near the Eddington limit for a 1Msun_ compact object. The existence of the dust scattering halo necessitates a prolonged X-ray activity period prior to the ROSAT observation.

The X-ray spectrum consists of an ultra-soft component and a high-energy power-law tail that extends to at least 25 keV. The ultra-soft component may be modeled by either a cutoff power-law or a multicolor blackbody disk model. The latter model allows the evolution in spectrum and intensity observed during the outburst to be accounted for by the change in a single parameter - the temperature at the innermost disk radius. We demonstrate that at least one other accretion disk model is able to account for these changes by the variation of a single parameter. During one of the three EXOSAT observations, EXO 1846-031 exhibited significant intensity variability which probably originates from the power-law component.

abstract = {We have observed the Galactic black hole transient 4U 1630-47 during the decay of its 2016 outburst with Chandra and Swift to investigate the properties of the dust scattering halo created by the source. The scattering halo shows a structure that includes a bright ring between 80" and 240" surrounding the source, and a continuous distribution beyond 250". An analysis of the $^{12}$CO $J=1-0$ map and spectrum in the line of sight to the source indicate that a molecular cloud with a radial velocity of -79 km s$^{-1}$ (denoted MC -79) is the main scattering body that creates the bright ring. We found additional clouds in the line of sight, calculated their kinematic distances and resolved the well known "near" and "far" distance ambiguity for most of the clouds. At the favored far distance estimate of MC -79, the modeling of the surface brightness profile results in a distance to 4U 1630-47 of 11.5 $\pm$ 0.3 kpc. If MC -79 is at the near distance, then 4U 1630-47 is at 4.7 $\pm$ 0.3 kpc. Future Chandra, Swift, and sub-mm radio observations not only can resolve this ambiguity, but also would provide information regarding properties of dust and distribution of all molecular clouds along the line of sight. Using the results of this study we also discuss the nature of this source and the reasons for the anomalously low soft state observation observed during the 2010 decay.},

@article{Jonker2004_4U1543-47_d,
abstract = {We investigated the reported distances of Galactic black hole (BH) and neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). Comparing the distances derived for the neutron stars Cyg X-2 and XTE J2123-058 using the observed Eddington limited photospheric radius expansion bursts with the distances derived using the observed radius and effective temperature of the companion star, we find that the latter are smaller by approximately a factor of 1.5-2. The latter method is often employed to determine the distance to BH LMXBs. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the stellar absorption lines in fast rotating companion stars are different from those in the slowly rotating template stars as was found before for early-type stars. This could lead to a systematic mis-classification of the spectral type of the companion star, which in turn would yield a systematic error in the distance. Further, we derive a distance of 4.0-1.2+2.0 kpc for V404 Cyg, using parameters available in the literature. The interstellar extinction seems to have been overestimated for XTE J1550-564 and possibly for two other BH sources (H 1705-25 and GS 2000+25) as well. As a result of this, the distance to XTE J1550-564 may have been underestimated by as much as a factor three. We find that, using the new distances for XTE J1550-564 and V404 Cyg, the maximum outburst luminosity for at least five, but perhaps even seven, of the 15 BH soft X-ray transients exceed the Eddington luminosity for a 10-M⊙ BH - showing that these systems would be classified as ultra-luminous X-ray sources had we observed them in other Galaxies. This renders support for the idea that many ultra-luminous X-ray sources are stellar-mass rather than intermediate-mass BHs. We find that the rms-value of the distance to the Galactic plane for BHs is consistent with that of neutron star LMXBs. This suggests that BHs could also receive a kick-velocity during their formation, although this has to be investigated in more detail. We find that the Galactic neutron star and BH l- and b-distributions are consistent with being the same. The neutron star and BH distribution is asymmetric in/with an excess of systems between -30° < l < 0° over systems with 0° < l < 30°.},

abstract = {We present contemporaneous, broadband, near-infrared spectroscopy (0.9-2.45 $\mu$m) and H-band photometry of the black hole X-ray binary, XTEJ1118+480. We determined the fractional dilution of the NIR ellipsoidal light curves of the donor star from other emission sources in the system by comparing the absorption features in the spectrum with field stars of known spectral type. We constrained the donor star spectral type to K7V-M1V and determined that the donor star contributed 54\% ± 27\% of the H-band flux at the epoch of our observations. This result underscores the conclusion that the donor star cannot be assumed to be the only NIR emission source in quiescent X-ray binaries. The H-band light curve shows a double-humped asymmetric modulation with extra flux at orbital phase 0.75. The light curve was fitted with a donor star model light curve, taking into account a constant second flux component based on the dilution analysis. We also fitted models that included emission from the donor star, a constant component from the accretion disk, and a phase-variable component from the bright spot where the mass accretion stream impacts the disk. These simple models with reasonable estimates for the component physical parameters can fully account for the observed light curve, including the extra emission at phase 0.75. From our fits, we constrained the binary inclination to 68° ≤ i ≤ 79°. This leads to a black hole mass of 6.9 M {\textperiodcentered} ≤ M{\textperiodcentered}BH ≤ 8.2 M{\textperiodcentered}. Long-term variations in the NIR light curve shape in XTEJ1118+480 are similar to those seen in other X-ray binaries and demonstrate the presence of continued activity and variability in these systems even when in full quiescence. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {Estimates of the black hole mass $M$ and dimensionless spin $a$ in the microquasar GRO J1655-40 implied by strong gravity effects related to the timing and spectral measurements are controversial, if the mass restriction determined by the dynamics related to independent optical measurements, $M_{\rm opt}=(5.4\pm0.3) M_{\odot}$, are applied. The timing measurements of twin high-frequency (HF) quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) with frequency ratio $3:2$ and the simultaneously observed low-frequency (LF) QPO imply the spin in the range $a\in(0.27-0.29)$ if models based on the frequencies of the geodesic epicyclic motion are used to fit the timing measurements, and correlated creation of the twin HF QPOs and the LF QPO at a common radius is assumed. On the other hand, the spectral continuum method implies $a\in(0.65-0.75)$, and the Fe-line-profile method implies $a\in(0.94-0.98)$. This controversy can be cured, if we abandon the assumption of the occurrence of the twin HF QPOs and the simultaneously observed LF QPO at a common radius. We demonstrate that the epicyclic resonance model of the twin HF QPOs is able to predict the spin in agreement with the Fe-profile method, but no model based on the geodesic epicyclic frequencies can be in agreement with the spectral continuum method. We also show that the non-geodesic string loop oscillation model of twin HF QPOs predicts spin $a>0.3$ under the optical measurement limit on the black hole mass, in agreement with both the spectral continuum and Fe-profile methods.},

@article{Sriram2012_XTEJ1817-330_dips,
abstract = {Context. The evolution of different types of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and the coupled radiative/physical changes in the accretion disk are still poorly understood. In a few black hole binaries it was found that fast evolution of QPOs is associated with spectral variations. These studies in other black hole binaries are important to understand the QPO phenomenon. Aims. We study fast QPO transitions and accompanying spectral variations of the black hole transient XTE J1817-330 to investigate the causes of the spectral variation during the QPO transition. Methods. Recently, QPOs in ten RXTE observations of XTE J1817-330 were found. We found that among these, only one observation shows erratic dips in its X-ray light curve. The power density spectra and the corresponding energy spectra were extracted and analyzed for the dip and non-dip sections of the light curve. Results. We found that type-B $\sim$ 6 Hz QPO changes into type-A QPO in a few tens of seconds along with a flux decrease. This transient evolution is accompanied by a significant spectral variation. Conclusions. We report a transient QPO feature and accompanying spectral variation in XTE J1817-330. Based on our findings, we discuss the origin of fast evolution of QPOs and spectral variations. {\textcopyright} ESO, 2012.},

abstract = {Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) are mostly found in x-ray transients, a subclass of x-ray binaries that exhibit violent outbursts. None of the 50 galactic BHs known show eclipses, which is surprising for a random distribution of inclinations. Swift J1357.2-093313 is a very faint x-ray transient detected in 2011. On the basis of spectroscopic evidence, we show that it contains a BH in a 2.8-hour orbital period. Further, high-time-resolution optical light curves display profound dips without x-ray counterparts. The observed properties are best explained by the presence of an obscuring toroidal structure moving outward in the inner disk, seen at very high inclination. This observational feature should play a key role in models of inner accretion flows and jet collimation mechanisms in stellar-mass BHs.},

We report a detailed spectral analysis of this source by using the archived data of NuSTAR. A total of nine observations covered the complete outburst evolution of MAXI J1348-630 from the hard state to the soft state and finally back to the hard state. Additionally, the intermediate state is found in the transition from the hard state to the soft state. We use the state-of-the-art reflection model relxill family to fit all the nine spectra, and the spectra from two focal plane module detectors of NuSTAR are jointly fitted for each observation. In particular, we concentrate on the results of the black hole spin parameter and the inclination of the accretion disc. Based on the analysis of the inner radius of the accretion disc, we obtain the spin parameter a ∗ =0.78 -0.04+0.04, and the inclination angle of the inner disc i = 29.2-0.5}+0.3 °. Furthermore, we also find that when the black hole is in the hard state, the accretion disc would show a significant truncation. The high iron abundance and ionization of the accretion disc obtained in the fitting results can be possibly explained by the high density of the accretion disc.},

The position of the source was measured by Chandra (RA=13h48m12.878s, Dec=$-$63$^{\circ}$16'28.85") with enhanced accuracy. The soft X-ray spectrum (1$-$6 keV) was intensively studied using Chandra/HETG from which multiple absorption-features corresponding to Fe XXII, Fe XXIII, Si XII, Cl XVI, S XV, Ar XVIII lines and the emission features corresponding to Fe XXI, Fe XXIII, Ar XVI lines were detected. We studied the first broadband spectrum for this black hole that included fluxes in radio, optical, ultraviolet and X-ray energy bands using data from ALMA (band 3, 4, 6 and 7; 89.56$-$351.44 GHz) and swift (UVOT and XRT). The broadband study suggested that the source was accompanied by strong blackbody radiation from the disk associated with weak synchrotron emission from the compact jets. The X-ray spectrum was also studied using NuSTAR in the range of 3$-$78 keV. We studied the evolution of spectral parameters using NuSTAR observations (from MJD 58655 to MJD 58672) when the source remained in the canonical hard state during the outburst of June 2019. We detected two type-C QPOs during the outburst of June 2019 with decreasing centroid frequencies from 0.82 Hz to 0.67 Hz and decreasing RMS amplitude from 7.6 per cent to 2.1 per cent. The hardness ratio showed significant variation during the outburst of April 2019 but remained almost constant during the outburst of June 2019. The spectral evolution in the hardness intensity diagram was studied during the outbursts.},

@article{Motta2015_inclination_dips,
abstract = {We present a systematic study of the orbital inclination effects on black hole transients fast time-variability properties. We have considered all the black hole binaries that have been densely monitored by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer satellite. We find that the amplitude of low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) depends on the orbital inclination. type-C QPOs are stronger for nearly edge-on systems (high inclination), while type-B QPOs are stronger when the accretion disc is closer to face-on (low inclination). Our results also suggest that the noise associated with type-CQPOs is consistent with being stronger for low-inclination sources, while the noise associated with type-B QPOs seems inclination independent. These results are consistent with a geometric origin of the type-C QPOs-for instance arising from relativistic precession of the inner flow within a truncated disc-while the noise would correspond to intrinsic brightness variability from mass accretion rate fluctuations in the accretion flow. The opposite behaviour of type-B QPOs-stronger in low-inclinations sources-supports the hypothesis that type-B QPOs are related to the jet, the power of which is the most obvious measurable parameter expected to be stronger in nearly face-on sources.},

Similar kind of dips for GRO J1655-40 were found in 90 s measurements of the RXTE ASM during the same outburst. The duration of the dips in both sources is of the order of minutes. The occurrences of the dips observed with the RXTE PCA and ASM in GRO J1655-40 are consistent with the optically determined orbital period, and were found between photometric orbital phases 0.72 and 0.86. This constitutes the first evidence for orbital variations in X-rays for GRO J1655-40. The PCA data indicate that an absorbing medium is responsible for these dips. The X-ray spectra during the dips can be best described by a heavily absorbed component and an unabsorbed component.

abstract = {We report a comprehensive study on spectral and timing properties of hard X-ray dips uniquely observed in some so-called variability classes of the micro-quasars GRS 1915+105 and IGR J17091-3624. These dips are characterized by a sudden decline in the 2.0-60.0 keV X-ray intensity by a factor of 4-12 simultaneous with the increase in hardness ratio by a factor of 2-4. Using 31 observations of GRS 1915+105 with RXTE/PCA, we show that different behaviors are observed in different types of variability classes, and we find that a dichotomy is observed between classes with abrupt transitions versus those with smoother evolution. For example, both energy-lag spectra and frequency-lag spectra of hard X-ray dips in classes with abrupt transitions and shorter dip intervals show hard-lag (hard photons lag soft photons), while both lag spectra during hard dips in classes with smoother evolution and longer dip intervals show soft-lag. Both lag time-scales are of the order of 100-600 mS. We also show that timing and spectral properties of hard X-ray dips observed in light curves of IGR J17091-3624 during its 2011 outburst are consistent with the properties of the abrupt transitions in GRS 1915+105 rather than smooth evolutions. A global correlation between the X-ray intensity cycle time and hard dip time is observed for both abrupt and smooth transition which may be due to two distinct physical processes whose time-scales are eventually correlated. We discuss implications of our results in the light of some generic models. {\textcopyright} 2013. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Enhanced emission from the dense gas tracer HCN (relative to HCO$^+ $) has been proposed as a signature of active galactic nuclei (AGN). In a previous single-dish millimeter line survey we identified galaxies with HCN/HCO$ ^+ $ (1-0) intensity ratios consistent with those of many AGN but whose mid-infrared spectral diagnostics are consistent with little to no ( $\lesssim15\% $) contribution of an AGN to the bolometric luminosity. To search for putative heavily obscured AGN, we present and analyze \nustar hard X-ray (3-79 keV) observations of four such galaxies from the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey. We find no X-ray evidence for AGN in three of the systems and place strong upper limits on the energetic contribution of any heavily obscured ($N_{\rm H}>10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) AGN to their bolometric luminosity. The X-ray flux upper limits are presently an order of magnitude below what XDR-driven chemistry model predict are necessary to drive HCN enhancements. In a fourth system we find a hard X-ray excess consistent with the presence of an AGN, but contributing only $\sim3\%$ of the bolometric luminosity. It is also unclear if the AGN is spatially associated with the HCN enhancement. We further explore the relationship between HCN/HCO$^+$ (for several $\mathrm{J}_\mathrm{upper}$ levels) and $L_\mathrm{AGN}/L_\mathrm{IR}$ for a larger sample of systems in the literature. We find no evidence for correlations between the line ratios and the AGN fraction derived from X-rays, indicating that HCN/HCO$^+$ intensity ratios are not driven by the energetic dominance of AGN, nor are they reliable indicators of whether SMBH accretion is ongoing.},

Using a simple Monte Carlo approach, we simulate a range of spectra corresponding to physical parameters varying, then calculate the resulting variance spectra. Starting from a variable power law, we build up a set of models corresponding to the different physical processes that can affect the final excess variance spectrum.We show that the complex excess variance spectrum of IRAS 13224-3809 can be well described by such an intrinsic variability model, where the power-law variability is damped by relativistic reflection and enhanced by an ultra-fast outflow. The reflection flux is correlated with that of the power law, but not perfectly. We argue that this correlation is stronger at high frequencies, where reverberation lags are detected, while excess variance spectra are typically dominated by low-frequency variability.},

@article{Chartas2021_wind_AGN_XMM_highz,
abstract = {We present results from a comprehensive study of ultrafast outflows (UFOs) detected in a sample of fourteen quasars, twelve of which are gravitationally lensed, in a redshift range of 1.41-3.91, near the peak of the AGN and star formation activity. New XMM-Newton observations are presented for six of them which were selected to be lensed and contain a narrow absorption line (NAL) in their UV spectra. Another lensed quasar was added to the sample, albeit already studied, because it was not searched for UFOs. The remaining seven quasars of our sample are known to contain UFOs. The main goals of our study are to infer the outflow properties of high-z quasars, constrain their outflow induced feedback, study the relationship between the outflow properties and the properties of the ionizing source, and compare these results to those of nearby AGN. Our study adds six new detections ( > 99\% confidence) of UFOs at z > 1.4, almost doubling the current number of cases. Based on our survey of six quasars selected to contain a NAL and observed with XMM-Newton, the coexistence of intrinsic UV NALs and UFOs is found to be significant in > 83\% of these quasars suggesting a link between multiphase AGN feedback properties of the meso- and micro-scale. The kinematic luminosities of the UFOs of our high-z sample are large compared to their bolometric luminosities (median of L_K/L_Bol $\sim$ 50%). This suggests they provide efficient feedback to influence the evolution of their host galaxies and that magnetic driving may be a significant contributor to their acceleration.},

@article{Tombesi2010_wind_AGN_XMM,
abstract = {Context. Blue-shifted Fe K absorption lines have been detected in recent years between 7 and 10 keV in the X-ray spectra of several radio-quiet AGNs. The derived blue-shifted velocities of the lines can often reach mildly relativistic values, up to 0.2-0.4c. These findings are important because they suggest the presence of a previously unknown massive and highly ionized absorbing material outflowing from their nuclei, possibly connected with accretion disk winds/outflows. Aims. The scope of the present work is to statistically quantify the parameters and incidence of the blue-shifted Fe K absorption lines through a uniform analysis on a large sample of radio-quiet AGNs. This allows us to assess their global detection significance and to overcome any possible publication bias. Methods. We performed a blind search for narrow absorption features at energies greater than 6.4 keV in a sample of 42 radio-quiet AGNs observed with XMM-Newton. A simple uniform model composed by an absorbed power-law plus Gaussian emission and absorption lines provided a good fit for all the data sets. We derived the absorption lines parameters and calculated their detailed detection significance making use of the classical F-test and extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Results. We detect 36 narrow absorption lines on a total of 101 XMM-Newton EPIC pn observations. The number of absorption lines at rest-frame energies higher than 7 keV is 22. Their global probability to be generated by random fluctuations is very low, less than 3 × 10-8, and their detection have been independently confirmed by a spectral analysis of the MOS data, with associated random probability <10-7. We identify the lines as Fe XXV and Fe XXVI K-shell resonant absorption. They are systematically blue-shifted, with a velocity distribution ranging from zero up to $\sim$0.3c, with a peak and mean value at ∼0.1c. We detect variability of the lines on both EWs and blue-shifted velocities among different XMM-Newton observations even on time-scales as short as a few days, possibly suggesting somewhat compact absorbers. Moreover, we find no significant correlation between the cosmological red-shifts of the sources and the lines blue-shifted velocities, ruling out any systematic contamination by local absorption. If we define ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) those highly ionized absorbers with outflow velocities higher than 104 km s -1, then the majority of the lines are consistent with being associated to UFOs and the fraction of objects with detected UFOs in the whole sample is at least ∼35\%. This fraction is similar for type 1 and type 2 sources. The global covering fraction of the absorbers is consequently estimated to be in the range C ∼ 0.4-0.6, thereby implying large opening angles. Conclusions. From our systematic X-ray spectral analysis on a large sample of radio-quiet AGNs we have been able to clearly assess the global veracity of the blue-shifted Fe K absorption lines at E > 7 keV and to overcome their publication bias. These lines indicate that UFOs are a rather common phenomenon observable in the central regions of these sources and they are probably the direct signature of AGN accretion disk winds/ejecta. The detailed photo-ionization modeling of these absorbers is presented in a companion paper. {\textcopyright} 2010 ESO.},

@article{Gofford2013_wind_AGN_Suzaku,
abstract = {We present the results of a new spectroscopic study of Fe K-band absorption in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Using data obtained from the Suzaku public archive we have performed a statistically driven blind search for Fe XXV He$\alpha$ and/or Fe XXVI Ly$\alpha$ absorption lines in a large sample of 51 Type 1.0-1.9 AGN. Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations we find that statistically significant absorption is detected at E ≳ 6.7 keV in 20/51 sources at the PMC ≥ 95 per cent level, which corresponds to $\sim$40 per cent of the total sample. In all cases, individual absorption lines are detected independently and simultaneously amongst the two (or three) available X-ray imaging spectrometer detectors, which confirms the robustness of the line detections. The most frequently observed outflow phenomenology consists of two discrete absorption troughs corresponding to Fe XXV He$\alpha$ and Fe XXVI Ly$\alpha$ at a common velocity shift. From xstar fitting the mean column density and ionization parameter for the Fe K absorption components are log (NH/cm-2) ≈ 23 and log ($\xi$/erg cm s-1) ≈ 4.5, respectively. Measured outflow velocities span a continuous range from <1500 km s-1 up to $\sim$100 000 km s-1, with mean and median values of $\sim$0.1 c and $\sim$0.056 c, respectively. The results of this work are consistent with those recently obtained using XMM-Newton and independently provides strong evidence for the existence of very highly ionized circumnuclear material in a significant fraction of both radio-quiet and radio-loud AGN in the local universe. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

We derived expressions for the optimal bin size for model spectra as well as for observed data using different levels of sophistication. Results. It is shown that by taking into account both the number of photons in a given spectral model bin and their average energy over the bin size, the number of model energy bins and the size of the response matrix can be reduced by a factor of 10-100. The response matrix should then contain the response at the bin centre as well as its derivative with respect to the incoming photon energy. We provide practical guidelines for how to construct optimal energy grids as well as how to structure the response matrix. A few examples are presented to illustrate the present methods.},

The 2015 outburst of the black hole transient V404 Cygni provided a unique opportunity for studying both types of outflows in the same system. We used contemporaneous X-ray (Chandra Observatory) and optical (Gran Telescopio Canarias, GTC) spectroscopy, in addition to hard X-ray light curves (INTEGRAL). We show that the kinetic properties of the wind, as derived from P-Cyg profiles detected in the optical range at low hard X-ray fluxes and in a number of X-ray transitions during luminous flares, are remarkably similar. Furthermore, strictly simultaneous data taken at intermediate hard X-ray fluxes show consistent emission line properties between the optical and the X-ray emission lines, which most likely arise in the same accretion disc wind. We discuss several scenarios to explain the properties of the wind, favouring the presence of a dynamic, multi-phase outflow during the entire outburst of the system. This study, together with the growing number of wind detections with fairly similar characteristic velocities at different wavelengths, suggest that wind-type X-ray binary outflows might be predominantly multi-phase in nature.},

Over two epochs of Chandra gratings observations, we see numerous highly ionized metal lines, superimposed on a hot, disc-dominated X-ray continuum. The measured inner disc temperatures and luminosities imply an unfeasibly small inner disc radius, such that we suggest that the central engine of V4641 Sgr is obscured, and we are viewing scattered X-rays. We find that the emission lines in the Chandra spectra cannot be constrained by a single photoionized model, instead finding that two separate photoionized model components are required, one to reproduce the iron lines and a second for the other metals. We compare the observed X-ray spectra of V4641 Sgr to optical studies during previous outbursts of the source, suggesting that the lines originate in an accretion disc wind, potentially with a spherical geometry.},

@article{Homan2016_wind_LMXB_jet_simultaneous,
abstract = {Recent work on jets and disk winds in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) suggests that they are to a large extent mutually exclusive, with jets observed in spectrally hard states and disk winds observed in spectrally soft states. In this paper we use existing literature on jets and disk winds in the luminous neutron star (NS) LMXB GX 13+1, in combination with archival Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data, to show that this source is likely able to produce jets and disk winds simultaneously. We find that jets and disk winds occur in the same location on the source's track in its X-ray color-color diagram. A further study of literature on other luminous LMXBs reveals that this behavior is more common, with indications for simultaneous jets and disk winds in the black hole LMXBs V404 Cyg and GRS 1915+105 and the NS LMXBs Sco X-1 and Cir X-1. For the three sources for which we have the necessary spectral information, we find that the simultaneous jets/winds all occur in their spectrally hardest states. Our findings indicate that in LMXBs with luminosities above a few tens of percent of the Eddington luminosity, jets and disk winds are not mutually exclusive, and that the presence of disk winds does not necessarily result in jet suppression.},

@article{CastroSegura2022_NS_wind_UV_2019,
abstract = {All disc-accreting astrophysical objects produce powerful disc winds. In compact binaries containing neutron stars or black holes, accretion often takes place during violent outbursts. The main disc wind signatures during these eruptions are blue-shifted X-ray absorption lines, which are preferentially seen in disc-dominated ‘soft states'1,2. By contrast, optical wind-formed lines have recently been detected in ‘hard states', when a hot corona dominates the luminosity3. The relationship between these signatures is unknown, and no erupting system has as yet revealed wind-formed lines between the X-ray and optical bands, despite the many strong resonance transitions in this ultraviolet (UV) region4. Here we report that the transient neutron star binary Swift J1858.6-0814 exhibits wind-formed, blue-shifted absorption lines associated with C iv, N v and He ii in time-resolved UV spectroscopy during a luminous hard state, which we interpret as a warm, moderately ionized outflow component in this state. Simultaneously observed optical lines also display transient blue-shifted absorption. Decomposing the UV data into constant and variable components, the blue-shifted absorption is associated with the former. This implies that the outflow is not associated with the luminous flares in the data. The joint presence of UV and optical wind features reveals a multi-phase and/or spatially stratified evaporative outflow from the outer disc5. This type of persistent mass loss across all accretion states has been predicted by radiation–hydrodynamic simulations6 and helps to explain the shorter-than-expected duration of outbursts7.},

abstract = {The black hole (BH) binary V404 Cyg entered the outburst phase in 2015 June after 26 yr of X-ray quiescence, and with its behaviour broke the outburst evolution pattern typical of most BH binaries. We observed the entire outburst with the Swift satellite and performed timeresolved spectroscopy of its most active phase, obtaining over a thousand spectra with exposures from tens to hundreds of seconds. All the spectra can be fitted with an absorbed power-law model, which most of the time required the presence of a partial covering. A blueshifted iron-K$\alpha$ line appears in 10 per cent of the spectra together with the signature of high column densities, and about 20 per cent of the spectra seem to show signatures of reflection. None of the spectra showed the unambiguous presence of soft disc-blackbody emission, while the observed bolometric flux exceeded the Eddington value in 3 per cent of the spectra. Our results can be explained assuming that the inner part of the accretion flow is inflated into a slim disc that both hides the innermost (and brightest) regions of the flow, and produces a cold, clumpy, high-density outflow that introduces the high absorption and fast spectral variability observed. We argue that the BH in V404 Cyg might have been accreting erratically or even continuously at Eddington/super-Eddington rates - thus sustaining a surrounding slim disc - while being partly or completely obscured by the inflated disc and its outflow. Hence, the largest flares produced by the source might not be accretion-driven events, but instead the effects of the unveiling of the extremely bright source hidden within the system.},

@article{Homan2021_MAXIJ1803-298_dips_NICER_hintwind_2021,
abstract = {After the observations reported in ATel #14602, the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) has continued observing the outburst of the recently discovered X-ray transient MAXI J1803-298 (ATel #14587, #14588, #14591, #14594, #14597, #14598, #14601). A light curve from the full NICER data set, which covers May 2 UTC 12:55 to May 5 23:06 UTC, reveals three strong dipping intervals in the 0.5-10 keV band (see link below). These intervals are centered around May 2 17:31 UTC, May 5 09:07 UTC, and May 5 16:48 UTC. The beginning or end of the dipping activity was not observed for any of the dipping intervals, indicating that the dipping intervals last longer than 500 s. The time between the last two dipping intervals is $\sim$7.7 hrs. The time between the first and last dipping intervals is roughly nine times the interval between the second and third dips, suggesting that the dips may be periodic. All three dips showed a corresponding increase in spectral hardness (4-10 keV/0.5-2 keV). We analyzed the spectrum of the second dip and the persistent emission from the two good-time-intervals immediately following the dip. For the persistent emission we can fit a spectrum that is consistent with that reported in ATel #14602: an absorbed continuum of a power-law and a disk blackbody. We measure a neutral absorption column of $\sim$3.2(1)e21cm^-2, a power-law index of 1.73(1) and a disk temperature of 0.27(1) keV. The dip spectrum can be fitted with the same continuum model, but requires an additional absorber. We find that a partial covering warm absorber (zxipcf in XSPEC) fits better than a (partial covering) neutral absorber. For the zxipcf component we find an absorption column of 15.0(7)e22 cm^-2, an ionization parameter (log(xi)) of 2.32(2), and a covering fraction of 0.42(1). We further note that we see hints of Iron absorption lines around 6.6 keV and 7.0 keV in the spectrum of the third dipping interval, which was significantly deeper than the second dipping interval. The repeating absorption dips in MAXI J1803-298 are likely of the same nature as the nearly-periodic absorption dips seen in the light curves of some other X-ray binaries that are viewed at high inclination angles (>60 degrees). These recur on periods that are in general very close to the orbital periods of those systems. Given the limited NICER coverage of the dipping intervals in MAXI J1803-298 we suggest that the orbital period of the system is likely between 7 and 8 hrs, although an integer fraction of that cannot be ruled out with our data.},

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of three XMM-Newton observations of the black hole low-mass X-ray binary IGR J17091-3624 taken during its 2016 outburst. Radio observations obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array indicate the presence of a compact jet during all observations. From the best X-ray data fit results, we concluded that the observations were taken during a transition from a hard accretion state to a hard-intermediate accretion state. For Observations 1 and 2, a local absorber can be identified in the EPIC-pn spectra but not in the RGS spectra, preventing us from distinguishing between absorption local to the source and that from the hot ISM component. For Observation 3, on the other hand, we have identified an intrinsic ionized static absorber in both EPIC-pn and RGS spectra. The absorber, observed simultaneously with a compact jet emission, is characterized by an ionization parameter of 1.96 < log $\zeta$ < 2.05 and traced mainly by Ne x, Mg xii, Si xiii, and Fe xviii.},

abstract = {We constrain the binary parameters and the nature of the donor star of the eclipsing accreting X-ray binary IGR J17451−3022. The donor mass, its radius, and the system inclination angle are computed based on the system orbital period and eclipse duration recently reported. We find that the donor is most likely a main-sequence star with the mass comprised within the range $\sim$ (0.5−0.8) <i>M<i/><sub>⊙<sub/> and a radius of $\sim$ 0.7 <i>R<i/><sub>⊙<sub/>. Assuming that the accreting compact object in IGR J17451−3022 is a neutron star, the duration of the nearly total rectangular eclipses yields an inclination angle of the system of 71° ≲ <i>i<i/> ≲ 76°, compatible with the presence of dips in this system. We rule out the presence of either a brown or white dwarf. However, we find an alternative possibility that the donor star in IGR J17451−3022 could be a partially stripped giant with a very low mass, $\sim$ 0.2 <i>M<i/><sub>⊙<sub/>. This case requires a substantial mass loss prior to the formation of the giant-star He core. According to that solution, the radius would be $\sim$ 0.4 <i>R<i/><sub>⊙<sub/>, at <i>i<i/> $\sim$ 80°. We additionally show that the well-known approximate dependence of the giant-star radius exclusively on its core mass, breaks down below $\sim$ 0.3 <i>M<i/><sub>⊙<sub/>.},

The monitoring observations provided by the JEM-X instruments on board INTEGRAL and the Swift /XRT showed that the event lasted for about 9 months and that the emission of the source remained soft for the entire period. The source emission is dominated by a thermal component (kT ∼ 1.2 keV), most likely produced by an accretion disk. The XMM-Newton observation carried out during the outburst revealed the presence of multiple absorption features in the soft X-ray emission that could be associated with the presence of an ionized absorber lying above the accretion disk, as observed in many high inclination, low mass X-ray binaries. The XMM-Newton data also revealed the presence of partial and rectangular X-ray eclipses (lasting about 820 s) together with dips. The rectangular eclipses can be associated with increases in the overall absorption column density in the direction of the source. The detection of two consecutive X-ray eclipses in the XMM-Newton data allowed us to estimate the source orbital period at Porb = 22620.5+2.0-1.8 s (1$\sigma$ confidence level).},

In addition to quiescent observations for all sources, we also observed two of these sources (IGR J17451−3022 and XTE J1818−245) in outburst. We detect the quiescent counterpart for 12 out of 15 sources, and for the remaining 3, we report limiting magnitudes. The magnitudes of the detected counterparts range between Ks = 17.59 and Ks = 22.29 mag. We provide (limits on) the absolute magnitudes and finding charts of all sources. Of these 12 detections in quiescence, 7 detections represent the first quiescent reported values (for MAXI J1543−564, XTE J1726−476, IGR J17451−3022, XTE J1818−245, MAXI J1828−249, MAXI J1836−194, Swift J1910.2−0546), and 2 detections show fainter counterparts to XTE J1752−223 and XTE J2012+381 than previously reported. We used theoretical arguments and observed trends, for instance between the outburst and quiescent X-ray luminosity and orbital period Porb to derive an expected trend between Ks and Porb of Ks ∝ log Porb0.565. Comparing this to observations, we find a different behaviour. We discuss possible explanations for this result.},

The source was observed during a short outburst between 2008 October 03 and November 16. The evolution of the hardness-intensity diagram throughout the outburst is peculiar, in that it does not follow the canonical pattern through all the spectral states (the so-called q-track pattern) seen during the outburst of black hole transients. On the contrary, the source only makes a transition from the hard state to the hard-intermediate state. After this transition, the source decreases in luminosity and its spectrum hardens again. This behaviour is confirmed by both spectral and timing analyses. This kind of outburst has been rarely observed before in a transient BHC. {\textcopyright} 2009 RAS.},

In November 2003 after the end of its 2003 outburst, we noticed, in observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, the presence of a new and variable radio source about 4.6" to the East of H 1743-322, that was later found to move away from H 1743-322. In February 2004, we detected a radio source to the West of H 1743-322, symmetrically placed relative to the Eastern jet. In 2004, follow-up X-ray observations with {\em Chandra} led to the discovery of X-ray emission associated with the two radio sources. This likely indicates that we are witnessing the interaction of relativistic jets from H 1743-322 with the interstellar medium causing in-situ particle acceleration. The spectral energy distribution of the jets during the decay phase is consistent with a classical synchrotron spectrum of a single electron distribution from radio up to X-rays, implying the production of very high energy ($>$ 10 TeV) particles in those jets. We discuss the jet kinematics, highlighting the presence of a significantly relativistic flow in H 1743-322 almost a year after the ejection event.},

We collected and analyzed the data with the HXD/PIN, HXD/GSO and XIS cameras spanning the energy range from 0.7-200 keV. Fits to the spectra with simple models fail to detect narrow Fe XXV and Fe XXVI absorption lines, with 90\% confidence upper limits of 3.5 eV and 2.5 eV on the equivalent width, respectively. These limits are commensurate with those in the very high state, but are well below the equivalent widths of lines detected in the high/soft state, suggesting that disk winds are partially state-dependent. We discuss these results in the context of previous detections of ionized Fe absorption lines in H1743-322 and connections to winds and jets in accreting systems. Additionally, we report the possible detection of disk reflection features, including an Fe K emission line.},

abstract = {Distinct changes of the spectral and variability properties observed in black hole transients during a bright outburst deliver insight into the evolution of the accretion flow and accretion geometry. We investigated NICER and Swift monitoring observations of H 1743-322 during its 2018 outburst as well as NuSTAR and XMM-Newton data. The observed hardness ratios, rms amplitudes, and properties of quasiperiodic oscillations indicate that H 1743-322 showed another hard-state-only, or so-called "failed", outburst. The energy spectra obtained from NuSTAR and XMM-Newton data confirm the hard-state nature and give photon indices of ∼1.7, typically found in the hard state of H 1743-322. The NICER monitoring observations allow us to follow the evolution of covariance ratios during a hard-state-only outburst of H 1743-322 for the first time. We confirm that the presence of flat covariance ratios at low energies is established early in the outburst and find that this shape is maintained throughout the outburst.

@article{Stiele2016_H1743-322_failed_outburst_2014_XMM,
abstract = {Black hole transients evolve during bright outbursts, showing distinct changes in their spectral and variability properties. These changes are interpreted as evidence for changes in the accretion flow and in the X-ray-emitting regions. We obtained an anticipated XMM-Newton Target of Opportunity observation of H 1743-322 during its outburst in 2014 September. Based on data from eight outbursts observed in the last 10 yr, we expected to catch the start of the hard-to-soft state transition. The fact that neither the general shape of the observed power density spectrum nor the characteristic frequency shows an energy dependence implies that the source remained in the low-hard state at the time of our observation near outburst peak. The spectral properties agree with the source being in the low-hard state, and a Swift/XRT monitoring of the outburst revealed that H 1743-322 stayed in the low-hard state during the entire outburst (known as a 'failed outburst'). Here we derive the averaged QPO waveform and obtain phase-resolved spectra. A comparison of the phase-resolved spectra with the phase-averaged energy spectrum reveals spectral pivoting. We compare variability on long and short time-scales using covariance spectra and find that the covariance ratio does not show an increase towards lower energies. In other binaries an increase has been found. There are two possible explanations: either the absence of additional disc variability on longer time-scales is related to the high inclination of H 1743-322 compared with other black hole X-ray binaries, or it is the reason why we observe H 1743-322 during a failed outburst. More data on failed outbursts and on high-inclination sources will be needed in order to investigate these two possibilities further.},

We use the density and velocity structure derived from a radiation hydrodynamic code as input to a Monte Carlo radiation transport calculation. The initial conditions are matched to those of the black hole binary system H1743−322 in its soft, disc dominated state, where wind features are seen in Chandra grating data. Our simulation fits well to the observed line profile, showing that these physical wind models can be the origin of the absorption features seen, rather than requiring a magnetically driven wind. We show how the velocity structure is the key observable discriminator between magnetic and thermal winds. Magnetic winds are faster at smaller radii, whereas thermal winds transition to a static atmosphere at smaller radii. New data from XRISM (due for launch 2022 January) will give an unprecedented view of the physics of the wind launch and acceleration processes, but the existence of static atmospheres in small disc systems already rules out magnetic winds which assume self-similar magnetic fields from the entire disc as the origin of the absorption features seen.},

abstract = {Aims. The galactic superluminal microquasar GRO J1655-40 started a new outburst in February 2005, after seven years in quiescence, rising to a high/soft state in March 2005. In this paper we study the X-ray spectra during this rise. Methods. We observed GRO J1655-40 with XMM-Newton on 27 February 2005 in the low/hard state, and on three consecutive days in March 2005 during the rise of the source to its high/soft state. The EPIC-pn camera was used in the fast-read burst mode to avoid photon pile-up. Results. First, we contributed to the improvement of the calibration of the EPIC-pn, since the high flux received from the source required some refinements in the correction of the charge transfer efficiency of the camera. Second, we find that the X-ray spectrum of GRO J1655-40 is dominated in the high/soft state by the thermal emission from the accretion disk, with an inner radius of 13-14[D/3.2 kpc] km and a maximum temperature of 1.3 keV. We detected two absorption lines in the EPIC-pn spectra at 6.7-6.8 and 7.8-8.0 keV, which can be identified as the K$\alpha$ and K$\beta$ lines of either blended Fe XXV and Fe XXVI or blueshifted Fe XXV. We find no orbital dependence on the X-ray properties, which provides an upper limit for the inclination of the system of 73°. The RGS spectrometers reveal interstellar absorption features at 17.2 {\AA}, 17.5 {\AA} (Fe L edges), and 23.54 {\AA} (OI K$\alpha$). Finally, while checking the interstellar origin of the OI line, we found a general correlation of the OI K$\alpha$ line equivalent width with the hydrogen column density using several sources available in the literature. {\textcopyright} ESO 2007.},

@article{Brocksopp2006_GROJ1655-40_outburst_2005_Swift,
abstract = {We present Swift observations of the black hole X-ray transient, GRO J1655-40, during the recent outburst. With its multiwavelength capabilities and flexible scheduling, Swift is extremely well suited for monitoring the spectral evolution of such an event. GRO J1655-40 was observed on 20 occasions and data were obtained by all instruments for the majority of epochs. X-ray spectroscopy revealed spectral shapes consistent with the 'canonical' low/hard, high/soft and very high states at various epochs. The soft X-ray source (0.3-10 keV) rose from quiescence and entered the low/hard state, when an iron emission line was detected. The soft X-ray source then softened and decayed, before beginning a slow rebrightening and then spending ∼3 weeks in the very high state. The hard X-rays (14-150 keV) behaved similarly but their peaks preceded those of the soft X-rays by up to a few days; in addition, the average hard X-ray flux remained approximately constant during the slow soft X-ray rebrightening, increasing suddenly as the source entered the very high state. These observations indicate (and confirm previous suggestions) that the low/hard state is key to improving our understanding of the outburst trigger and mechanism. The optical/ultraviolet light curve behaved very differently from that of the X-rays; this might suggest that the soft X-ray light curve is actually a composite of the two known spectral components, one gradually increasing with the optical/ultraviolet emission (accretion disc) and the other following the behaviour of the hard X-rays (jet and/or corona). {\textcopyright} 2005 RAS.},

@article{Jacquemin-Ide2019_wind_weak_magnetic_JEDSAD_modeling,
abstract = {Semi-analytical models of disc outflows have successfully described magnetically driven, self-confined super-Alfv{\'{e}}nic jets from near-Keplerian accretion discs. These jet-emitting discs (JEDs) are possible for high levels of disc magnetization $\mu$ defined as $\mu$ = 2/$\beta$, where beta is the usual plasma parameter. In near-equipartition JEDs, accretion is supersonic and jets carry away most of the disc angular momentum. However, these solutions prove difficult to compare with cutting-edge numerical simulations, for the reason that numerical simulations show wind-like outflows but in the domain of small magnetization. In this work, we present for the first time self-similar isothermal solutions for accretion-ejection structures at small magnetization levels. We elucidate the role of magnetorotational instability-like (MRI) structures in the acceleration processes that drive this new class of solutions. The disc magnetization $\mu$ is the main control parameter: Massive outflows driven by the pressure of the toroidal magnetic field are obtained up to $\mu$ ∼ 10−2, while more tenuous centrifugally driven outflows are obtained at larger $\mu$ values. The generalized parameter space and the astrophysical consequences are discussed. We believe that these new solutions could be a stepping stone in understanding the way astrophysical discs drive either winds or jets. Defining jets as self-confined outflows and winds as uncollimated outflows, we propose a simple analytical criterion based on the initial energy content of the outflow, to discriminate jets from winds. We show that jet solution is achieved at all magnetization levels, while winds could be obtained only in weakly magnetized discs that feature heating.},

@article{Waters2018_wind_magnetic_thermal_modeling,
abstract = {Magnetic, radiation pressure, and thermal driving are the three mechanisms capable of launching accretion disk winds. In X-ray binaries, radiation pressure is often not significant, as in many systems the luminosity is too low for driving due to continuum transitions yet too high for driving due to line transitions. This leaves thermal and magnetic driving as the contender launching mechanisms in these systems. Using Athena++, we perform axisymmetric ideal MHD simulations that include radiative heating and cooling processes appropriate for Compton heated winds to show that the inclusion of magnetic fields into a thermally driven wind has the opposite effect of what one might expect: rather than provide a velocity boost, the thermal wind is suppressed in low plasma beta regions where the field lines are strong enough to reshape the direction of the flow. Our analysis reveals that magneto-centrifugal launching is present but weak, while the reduction in wind velocity is not due to the change in gravitational potential through the magnetically imposed streamline geometry, but rather due to the increased flow tube area just above the surface of the disk, which is less conducive to acceleration. Our results suggest that for magnetothermal wind models to be successful at producing fast dense outflows in low mass X-ray binaries, the winds must be magnetically launched well within the Compton radius.},

abstract = {X-ray irradiation heating of accretion discs in black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs) plays a key role in regulating their outburst cycles. However, despite decades of theoretical and observational efforts, the physical mechanism(s) responsible for irradiating these discs remains largely unknown.We have built an observation-based methodology to estimate the strength of irradiation of BHXB discs by combining multiwavelength X-ray and optical/infrared (OIR) data throughout transient outbursts. We apply this to ∼15 yr of activity in the Galactic BHXB GX339-4. Our findings suggest that the irradiation heating required by the optical data is large in this system. Direct illumination of the outer disc does not produce sufficient irradiation, but this should also produce a thermal-radiative wind which adds to the irradiation heating by scattering flux down on to the disc. However, analytic estimates of X-ray illumination from scattering in the wind are still not sufficient to produce the observed heating, even in combination with direct illumination. Either the analytic thermal-radiative wind models are underestimating the effect of the wind, or there are additional scattering mechanisms at work, such as magnetically driven outflows, acting to increase the OIR flux. While wind-driven irradiation is likely a common feature among long-period BHXBs, fully understanding the driving mechanism(s) behind such a wind will require radiation hydrodynamic simulations.},

@article{Higginbottom2020_thermal_wind_hard_modeling,
abstract = {X-ray signatures of outflowing gas have been detected in several accreting black hole binaries, always in the soft state. A key question raised by these observations is whether these winds might also exist in the hard state. Here, we carry out the first full-frequency radiation hydrodynamic simulations of luminous (L = 0.5LEdd) black hole X-ray binary systems in both the hard and the soft state, with realistic spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Our simulations are designed to describe X-ray transients near the peak of their outburst, just before and after the hard-to-soft state transition. At these luminosities, it is essential to include radiation driving, and we include not only electron scattering, but also photoelectric and line interactions. We find powerful outflows with Mwind 2 'Macc are driven by thermal and radiation pressure in both hard and soft states. The hard-state wind is significantly faster and carries approximately 20 times as much kinetic energy as the soft-state wind. However, in the hard state the wind is more ionized, and so weaker X-ray absorption lines are seen over a narrower range of viewing angles. Nevertheless, for inclinations ≳80°, blueshifted windformed Fe XXV and Fe XXVI features should be observable even in the hard state. Given that the data required to detect these lines currently exist for only a single system in a luminous hard state - the peculiar GRS 1915+105 - we urge the acquisition of new observations to test this prediction. The new generation of X-ray spectrometers should be able to resolve the velocity structure.},

abstract = {We report on simultaneous Chandra/HETGS and RXTE observations of the transient stellar-mass black hole GRO J1655-40, made during its 2005 outburst. Chandra reveals a line-rich X-ray absorption spectrum consistent with a disk wind. Prior modeling of the spectrum suggested that the wind may be magnetically driven, potentially providing insights into the nature of disk accretion onto black holes. In this paper, we present results obtained with new models for this spectrum, generated using three independent photoionization codes: XSTAR, Cloudy, and our own code. Fits to the spectrum in particular narrow wavelength ranges, in evenly spaced wavelength slices, and across a broad wavelength band all strongly prefer a combination of high density, high ionization, and small inner radius. Indeed, the results obtained from all three codes require a wind that originates more than 10 times closer to the black hole and carrying a mass flux that is on the order of 1000 times higher than predicted by thermal driving models. If seminal work on thermally-driven disk winds is robust, magnetic forces may play a role in driving the disk wind in GRO J1655-40. However, even these modeling efforts must be regarded as crude given the complexity of the spectra. We discuss these results in the context of accretion flows in black holes and other compact objects.},

@article{Luketic2010_GROJ1655-40_wind_thermal_failure,
abstract = {We present the results of hydrodynamical simulations of the disk photosphere irradiated by strong X-rays produced in the innermost part of the disk of an accreting black hole. As expected, the irradiation heats the photosphere and drives a thermal wind. To apply our results to the well-studied X-ray transient source GRO J1655-40, we adopted the observed mass of its black hole and the observed properties of its X-ray radiation. To compare the results with the observations, we also computed transmitted X-ray spectra based on the wind solution. Our main finding is that the density of the fast-moving part of the wind is more than 1 order of magnitude lower than that inferred from the observations. Consequently, the model fails to predict spectra with line absorption as strong and as blueshifted as those observed. However, despite the thermal wind being weak and Compton thin, the ratio between the mass-loss rate and the mass-accretion rate is about seven. This high ratio is insensitive to the accretion luminosity, in the limit of lower luminosities. Most of the mass is lost from the disk between 0.07 and 0.2 of the Compton radius. We discovered that beyond this range the wind solution is self-similar. In particular, soon after it leaves the disk, the wind flows at a constant angle with respect to the disk. Overall, the thermal winds generated in our comprehensive simulations do not match the wind spectra observed in GRO J1655-40. This supports the conclusion of Miller et al. and Kallman et al. that the wind in GRO J1655-40, and possibly in other X-ray transients, may be driven by magnetic processes. This in turn implies that the disk wind carries even more material than our simulations predict and as such has a very significant impact on the accretion disk structure and dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2010.

abstract = {We report the detection of iron K-absorption lines in the energy spectra of the superluminal jet source GRO J1655[40. We observed the source with ASCA on four occasions from 1994 through 1996. SigniÐ-cant absorption-line features were found at 6.63 ^ 0.07 keV when the X-ray intensity was low (0.27{\`{E}}0.57 crab) and at 6.95 ^ 0.10 keV when the intensity was high (2.2 crab). The former are interpreted as resonance absorption lines from helium-like iron and the latter are those from hydrogen-like iron, respectively. This gives direct evidence for the presence of highly ionized plasma in a nonspherical conÐguration in the vicinity of the black hole. The change of the ionization state of iron suggests that the plasma is photoionized by X-ray irradiation. The observed equivalent width (about 60 eV for the helium-like Ka line) and the ionization parameter m (D103) constrain the size of the plasma to D1010 cm. The similarity of these properties to those of the other superluminal source GRS 1915]105 may imply some connection between the presence of such highly ionized plasma and the formation of rela-tivistic jets.},

abstract = {Recent Chandra observations of an outflowing gas in GRO J1655Ϫ40 resulted in a suggestion by Miller et al. that the wind in this system must be powered by a magnetic process that can also drive accretion through the disk around the black hole. The alternative explanations, of radiation pressure or thermally driven flows, were considered unsatisfactory because of the highly ionized level of the gas and because of the derived small distance from the black hole, well inside the minimum distance required for an efficient X-ray–heated wind. The present Letter shows that there is a simple photoionized wind solution for this system where the gas is much farther out than assumed by Miller et al., at . The expected wind velocity, as well as the computed 4.7 5.7 r/r p 10 –10 g equivalent widths of more than 50 absorption lines in this single-component one-dimensional model, are all in good agreement with the Chandra observations.},

@article{Dubus2019_wind_thermal_lightcurve_GROJ1655,
abstract = {Context. The observed signatures of winds from X-ray binaries are broadly consistent with thermal winds, which are driven by X-ray irradiation of the outer accretion disc. Thermal winds produce mass outflow rates that can exceed the accretion rate in the disc. Aims. We aim to study the impact of thermal wind mass loss on the stability and lightcurves of black hole X-ray binaries subject to the thermal-viscous instability driving their outbursts. Strong mass loss could stop outbursts early, as proposed for the 2015 outburst of V404 Cyg. Methods. We used an analytical model for thermal (Compton) wind mass loss as a function of radius, X-ray spectrum, and luminosity that was calibrated against numerical simulations. We also estimated the fraction of the X-rays, emitted close to the compact object, that are scattered back to the outer disc in the wind. Scattering in the thermal wind couples irradiation to the disc size and inner mass accretion rate. The disc evolution equations were modified to include this wind mass loss and the varying irradiation fraction. Results. Scattering in the strong wind expected of long Porb systems enhances the irradiation heating of the outer disc, keeping it stable against the thermal-viscous instability. This accounts very well for the existence of persistently bright systems with large discs, such as Cyg X-2, 1E 1740.7-2942, or GRS 1758-258. Mass loss from the thermal wind shortens the outburst, as expected, but it is insufficient in explaining the rapid decay timescale of black-hole X-ray binary outbursts. However, including the wind-related varying irradiation fraction produces lightcurves with plateaus in long Porb systems like GRO J1655-40. Plateau lightcurves may be a dynamical signature of enhanced irradiation due to scattering in thermal winds. Conclusions. Mass loss due to thermal winds is not a major driver for the outburst dynamics up to luminosities of 0.1-0.2 LEdd. Higher luminosities may produce stronger mass loss but studying them is complicated since the wind becomes opaque. Magnetic winds, which extract angular momentum with little mass loss, seem more promising to explain the fast decay timescales generically seen in black-hole X-ray binaries. Thermal winds can play an important role in the outburst dynamics through the varying irradiation heating. This may be evidenced by relating changes in wind properties, X-ray spectra, or luminosity with changes in the optical emission that traces the outer disc. Simulations should enable more accurate estimates of the dependence of the irradiation onto the disc as a function of irradiation spectrum, radius, and disc wind properties.},

@article{Uttley2015_GROJ1655-40_timing_2005_hypersoft,
abstract = {We report the identification and study of an unusual soft state of the black hole low-mass X-ray binary GRO J1655-40, observed during its 2005 outburst by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. Chandra X-ray grating observations have revealed a high-mass-outflow accretion disc wind in this state, and we show that the broad-band X-ray spectrum is remarkably similar to that observed in the so-called hypersoft state of the high-mass X-ray binary Cyg X-3, which possesses a strong stellar wind from a Wolf-Rayet secondary. The power-spectral density (PSD) of GRO J1655-40 shows a bending power-law shape, similar to that of canonical soft states albeit with larger fractional rms. However, the characteristic bend frequency of the PSD is strongly correlated with the X-ray flux, such that the bend frequency increases by two decades for less than a factor 2 increase in flux. The strong evolution of PSD bend frequency for very little change in flux or X-ray spectral shape seems to rule out the suppression of high-frequency variability by scattering in the wind as the origin of the PSD bend. Instead, we suggest that the PSD shape is intrinsic to the variability process and may be linked to the evolution of the scaleheight in a slim disc. An alternative possibility is that variability is introduced by variable absorption and scattering in the wind. We further argue that the hypersoft state in GRO J1655-40 and Cyg X-3 is associated with accretion close to or above the Eddington limit.},

@article{Done2018_thermal_winds_modeling_H1743_GROJ1655,
abstract = {Black hole binaries show equatorial disc winds at high luminosities, which apparently disappear during the spectral transition to the low/hard state. This is also where the radio jet appears, motivating speculation that both wind and jet are driven by different configurations of the same magnetic field. However, these systems must also have thermal winds, as the outer disc is clearly irradiated. We develop a predictive model of the absorption features from thermal winds, based on pioneering work of Begelman, McKee \& Shields. We couple this to a realistic model of the irradiating spectrum as a function of luminosity to predict the entire wind evolution during outbursts. We show that the column density of the thermal wind scales roughly with luminosity, and does not shut offat the spectral transition, though its visibility will be affected by the abrupt change in ionizing spectrum. We re-analyse the data from H1743-322, which most constrains the difference in wind across the spectral transition, and show that these are consistent with the thermal wind models. We include simple corrections for radiation pressure, which allows stronger winds to be launched from smaller radii. These winds become optically thick around Eddington, which may even explain the exceptional wind seen in one observation of GRO J1655-40. These data can instead be fit by magnetic wind models, but similar winds are not seen in this or other systems at similar luminosities. Hence, we conclude that the majority (perhaps all) of current data can be explained by thermal or thermal-radiative winds.},

The 0.3-200 keV spectra are complex with an overall continuum which may be modeled using an absorbed blackbody together with a weak, steep, power-law component. In addition, there is evidence for the presence of both a relativistically broadened Fe K line and a highly photo-ionized absorber. The photo-ionized absorber is responsible for strong K absorption lines of Fe XXV and Fe XXVI in the EPIC pn spectra and blue-shifted (V = -540 ± 120 km S-1) Ne X and Fe XXIV features in the RGS spectra. The parameters of the photo-ionized absorber were different during the two observations with the ionization parameter, log($\xi$), decreasing from 3.60 ± 0.04 to 3.30 ± 0.04 erg cm S-1 and the column density decreasing from (5.2±1.0) × 1022 atom cm-2 to (1.5±1.0) × 1022 atom cm-2 during the first and second observations as the 0.5-200 keV GRO J1655-40 luminosity decreased by around a half.

abstract = {We present ellipsoidal light-curve fits to the quiescent B, V, R and I light curves of GRO J1655-40 (Nova Scorpii 1994). The fits are based on a simple model consisting of a Rochelobe-filling secondary and an accretion disc around the black hole primary. Unlike previous studies, no assumptions are made concerning the interstellar extinction or the distance to the source; instead these are determined self-consistently from the observed light curves. In order to obtain tighter limits on the model parameters, we used the distance determination from the kinematics of the radio jet as an additional constraint. We obtain a value for the extinction that is lower than was assumed previously; this leads to lower masses for both the black hole and the secondary star of 5.4 ± 0.3 and 1.45 ± 0.35 M⊙, respectively. The errors in the determination of the model parameters are dominated by systematic errors, in particular arising from uncertainties in the modelling of the disc structure and uncertainties in the atmosphere model for the chemically anomalous secondary in the system. A lower mass of the secondary naturally explains the transient nature of the system if it is in either a late case A or early case B mass-transfer phase.},

abstract = {We report on a first census of Galactic black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) properties with the second data release (DR2) of Gaia, focusing on dynamically confirmed and strong candidate BH transients. Gaia DR2 provides five-parameter astrometric solutions including position, parallax and proper motion for 11 out of a sample of 24 systems. Distance estimates are tested with parallax inversion as well as Bayesian inference. We derive an empirically motivated characteristic scalelength of L = 2.17 ± 0.12 kpc for this BHXRB population to infer distances based upon an exponentially decreasing space density prior. Geometric DR2 parallaxes provide new, independent distance estimates, but the faintness of this population in quiescence results in relatively large fractional distance uncertainties. Despite this, DR2 estimates generally agree with the distances found in the literature. The most discrepant case is BW Cir, for which detailed studies of the donor star have suggested a distant location at 25 kpc. The large parallax and relatively high proper motion measured by DR2 instead indicate significantly smaller distances, suggesting that the source might be amongst the nearest of XRBs. However, both larger and smaller distances create problems for the interpretation of the source, and follow-up data are required to resolve its true nature. DR2 also provides a first distance estimate to one source, MAXI J1820+070, and novel proper motion estimates for seven sources. Peculiar velocities relative to Galactic rotation exceed ≈ 50 km s−1 for the bulk of the sample, with a median system kinetic energy of peculiar motion of ∼ 5 × 1047 erg. BW Cir could be a new high-velocity BHXRB if its astrometry is confirmed. A putative anticorrelation between peculiar velocity and BH mass is found, as expected in mass-dependent BH kick formation channels, but this trend remains weak in the DR2 data.},

abstract = {We report on a 120 ks Chandra/HETG spectrum of the black hole GRS 1915+105. The observation was made during an extended and bright soft state in June, 2015. An extremely rich disk wind absorption spectrum is detected, similar to that observed at lower sensitivity in 2007. The very high resolution of the third-order spectrum reveals four components to the disk wind in the Fe K band alone; the fastest has a blue-shift of v = 0.03c. Broadened re-emission from the wind is also detected in the first-order spectrum, giving rise to clear accretion disk P Cygni profiles. Dynamical modeling of the re-emission spectrum gives wind launching radii of r $\sim$ 10^(2-4) GM/c^2. Wind density values of n $\sim$ 10^(13-16) cm^-3 are then required by the ionization parameter formalism. The small launching radii, high density values, and inferred high mass outflow rates signal a role for magnetic driving. With simple, reasonable assumptions, the wind properties constrain the magnitude of the emergent magnetic field to B $\sim$ 10^(3-4) Gauss if the wind is driven via magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) pressure from within the disk, and B $\sim$ 10^(4-5) Gauss if the wind is driven by magnetocentrifugal acceleration. The MHD estimates are below upper limits predicted by the canonical alpha-disk model (Shakura \& Sunyaev 1973). We discuss these results in terms of fundamental disk physics and black hole accretion modes.},

abstract = {We present results from the Suzaku observation of the microquasar GRS 1915+105 performed during the 2005 October multiwavelength campaign. The data include both stable state (class$\chi$) and limit-cycle oscillation (class$\theta$). Correct interstellar absorption as well as effects of dust scattering are fully taken into account in the spectral analysis. The energy spectra in the 2-120 keV band in both states are all dominated by strong Comptonization of disk photons by optically thick ($\tau$ ≈ 7-10) and low-temperature (T e ≈ 2-3 keV) hybrid plasmas containing non-thermal electrons produced with 10\%-60\% of the total power input. Absorption lines of highly ionized Fe ions detected during the oscillation indicate that a strong disk wind is developed. The ionization stage of the wind correlates with the X-ray flux, supporting the photoionization origin. The iron-K emission line shows a strong variability during the oscillation; the reflection is strongest during the dip but disappears during the flare. We interpret this as evidence for "self-shielding" that the Comptonizing corona becomes geometrically thick in the flare phase, preventing photons from irradiating the outer disk. The low-temperature and high-luminosity disk emission suggests that the disk structure is similar to that in the very high state of canonical black hole binaries.

abstract = {We have carried out a precise energy spectral analysis of the superluminal jet source GRS 1915]105 observed with ASCA six times from 1994 to 1999. The source was so bright that most SIS data su †ered from event pileup. We have developed a new technique to circumvent the pileup e †ect, which enabled us to study the spectrum in detail and at high resolution (*E/E B 2\%). In the energy spectra of 1994 and 1995, resonant absorption lines of Ca XX Ka, Fe XXV Ka, Fe XXVI Ka, as well as blends of the absorption lines of Ni XXVII Ka ] Fe XXV Kb and Ni XXVIII Ka ] Fe XXVI Kb, were observed. Such absorption lines have not been found in other objects, except for iron absorption lines from GRO J1655[40, another superluminal jet source. We carried out a "" curve of growth {\"{I}}{\"{I}} analysis for the absorption lines and estimated column densities of the absorbing ions. We found that a plasma of moderate temperature (0.1{\`{E}}10 keV) and cosmic abundance cannot account for the observed large equivalent widths. The hydrogen column density of such plasma would be so high that the optical depth of Thomson scattering would be too thick cm$\sim$2). We require either a very high kinetic temperature of the ions (N H Z 1024 keV) or extreme overabundances In the former case, the ion column densities have (Z100 (Z100 Z _). reasonable values of 1017{\`{E}}1018 cm$\sim$2. We modeled the absorber as a photoionized disk which envelops the central X-ray source. Using a photoionization calculation code, we constrain physical parameters of the plasma disk, such as the ionization parameter, radius, and density. Estimated parameters were found to be consistent with those of a radiation-driven disk wind. These absorption line features may be peculiar to superluminal jet sources and related to the jet formation mechanism. Alternatively, they may be common characteristics of supercritical edge-on systems.},

We find that the complicated X-ray intensity curve of this source can be described by the rapid removal and replenishment of matter forming the inner part of an optically thick accretion disk, probably caused by a thermal-viscous instability analogous to that operating in dwarf novae, but here driven by the Lightman-Eardley instability. We find that the mass accretion rate in quiescence is 10^-6 solar masses per year. Only a small fraction of the energy liberated by accretion is emitted as radiation. We suggest that most of this energy is advected into the black hole in the high-viscosity state of the outburst cycle.},

@article{Fender1999_GRS1915+105_radio_jet,
abstract = {We present high-resolution MERLIN radio images of multiple relativistic ejections from GRS 1915+105 in 1997 October/November. The observations were made at a time of complex radio behaviour, corresponding to multiple optically thin outbursts and several days of rapid radio flux oscillations. This activity followed ∼20 d of a plateau state of inverted-spectrum radio emission and hard, quasi-stable X-ray emission. The radio imaging resolved four major ejection events from the system. As previously reported from earlier VLA observations of the source, we observe apparent superluminal motions resulting from intrinsically relativistic motions of the ejecta. However, our measured proper motions are significantly greater than those observed on larger angular scales with the VLA. Under the assumption of an intrinsically symmetric ejection, we can place an upper limit on the distance to GRS 1915+105 of 11.2 ± 0.8 kpc. Solutions for the velocities unambiguously require a higher intrinsic speed by about 0.1c than that derived from the earlier VLA observations, whilst the angle to the line of sight is not found to be significantly different. At a distance of 11 kpc, we obtain solutions of $\upsilon$ = 0.98+0.02-0.05c and $\theta$ = 66° ± 2°. The jet also appears to be curved on a scale that corresponds to a period of around 7 d. We observe significant evolution of the linear polarization of the approaching component, with large rotations in position angle and a general decrease in fractional polarization. This may be the result of increasing randomization of the magnetic field within the ejected component. We do not at any time detect significant linear polarization from the core, including periods when the flux density from this region is dominated by radio oscillations. The power input into the formation of the jet is very large, ≥1038 erg s-1 at 11 kpc for a pair plasma. If the plasma contains a cold proton for each electron, then the mass outflow rate, ≥1018 g s-1. is comparable to inflow rates previously derived from X-ray spectral fits.},

@article{Neilsen2011_GRS1915+105_wind_heartbeat,
abstract = {We present the first detailed phase-resolved spectral analysis of a joint Chandra High-Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer and Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observation of the $\rho$ variability class in the microquasar GRS1915+105. The $\rho$ cycle displays a high-amplitude, double-peaked flare that recurs roughly every 50s and is sometimes referred to as the "heartbeat" oscillation. The spectral and timing properties of the oscillation are consistent with the radiation pressure instability and the evolution of a local Eddington limit in the inner disk. We exploit strong variations in the X-ray continuum, iron emission lines, and the accretion disk wind to probe the accretion geometry over nearly six orders of magnitude in distance from the black hole. At small scales (1-10 Rg), we detect a burst of bremsstrahlung emission that appears to occur when a portion of the inner accretion disk evaporates due to radiation pressure. Jet activity, as inferred from the appearance of a short X-ray hard state, seems to be limited to times near minimum luminosity, with a duty cycle of 10\%. On larger scales (105-106 Rg), we use detailed photoionization arguments to track the relationship between the fast X-ray variability and the accretion disk wind. For the first time, we are able to show that changes in the broadband X-ray spectrum produce changes in the structure and density of the accretion disk wind on timescales as short as 5s. These results clearly establish a causal link between the X-ray oscillations and the disk wind and therefore support the existence of a disk-jet-wind connection. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the mass-loss rate in the wind may be sufficient to cause long-term oscillations in the accretion rate, leading to state transitions in GRS1915+105. {\textcopyright} 2011 The American Astronomical Society.

We find strong absorption lines from highly ionized iron, which are due to absorption by disk wind outflowing at a velocity of ∼1000 km s −1 along our line of sight. Two of the three observations show large amplitude oscillation in their light curves and the variation pattern corresponds to state $\kappa$ of GRS 1915+105. From time-averaged and flux-resolved analysis, we find that the variation in the ionization state of the disk wind follows the X-ray continuum on timescales from hundreds of seconds to months. The radial location of the disk wind is consistent with thermal driving. The mass-loss rate due to the outflowing wind is comparable to the mass accretion rate in the inner disk, which demonstrates the important role of the disk wind in the disk accretion system.},

abstract = {We report on the analysis of 100 ks INTEGRAL observations of the Galactic microquasar GRS 1915+105. We focus on INTEGRAL Revolution number 48 when the source was found to exhibit a new type of variability as preliminarily reported in Hannikainen (2003, A&A, 411, L415). The variability pattern, which we name $\xi$, is characterized by a pulsing behaviour, consisting of a main pulse and a shorter, softer, and smaller amplitude precursor pulse, on a timescale of 5 min in the JEM-X 3-35 keV lightcurve. We also present simultaneous RXTE data. From a study of the individual RXTE/PCA. pulse profiles we find that the rising phase is shorter and harder than the declining phase, which is opposite to what has been observed in other otherwise similar variability classes in this source. The position in the colour-colour diagram throughout the revolution corresponds to State A (Belloni et al. 2000, A&A, 355, 271) but not to any previously known variability class. We separated the INTEGRAL data into two subsets covering the maxima and minima of the pulses and fitted the resulting two broadband spectra with a hybrid thermal-non-thermal Comptonization model. The fits show the source to be in a soft state characterized by a strong disc component below ∼6 keV and Comptonization by both thermal and non-thermal electrons at higher energies. {\textcopyright} ESO 2005.},

abstract = {We present the analysis of the brightest flare that was recorded in the \emph{Insight}-HMXT data set, in a broad energy range (2$-$200 keV) from the microquasar GRS$\sim$1915+105 during an unusual low-luminosity state. This flare was detected by \emph{Insight}-HXMT among a series of flares during 2 June 2019 UTC 16:37:06 to 20:11:36, with a 2-200 keV luminosity of 3.4$-$7.27$\times10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Basing on the broad-band spectral analysis, we find that the flare spectrum shows different behaviors during bright and faint epochs. The spectrum of the flare can be fitted with a model dominated by a power-law component. Additional components show up in the bright epoch with a hard tail and in the faint epoch with an absorption line $\sim$ 6.78 keV. The reflection component of the latter is consistent with an inner disk radius $\sim$ 5 times larger than that of the former. These results on the giant flare during the "unusual" low-luminosity state of GRS$\sim$1915+105 may suggest that the source experiences a possible fast transition from a jet-dominated state to a wind-dominated state. We speculate that the evolving accretion disk and the large-scale magnetic field may play important roles in this peculiar huge flare.},

@article{Miller2020_GRS1915+105_obscured_Chandra,
abstract = {We report on Chandra gratings spectra of the stellar-mass black hole GRS 1915+105 obtained during a novel, highly obscured state. As the source entered this state, a dense, massive accretion disk wind was detected through strong absorption lines. Photionization modeling indicates that it must originate close to the central engine, orders of magnitude from the outer accretion disk. Strong, nearly sinusoidal flux variability in this phase yielded a key insight: the wind is blue-shifted when its column density is relatively low, but red-shifted as it approaches the Compton-thick threshold. At no point does the wind appear to achieve the local escape velocity; in this sense, it is a "failed wind." Later observations suggest that the disk ultimately fails to keep even the central engine clear of gas, leading to heavily obscured and Compton-thick states characterized by very strong Fe K emission lines. Indeed, these later spectra are successfully described using models developed for obscured AGN. We discuss our results in terms the remarkable similarity of GRS 1915+105 deep in its "obscured state" to Seyfert-2 and Compton-thick AGN, and explore how our understanding of accretion and obscuration in massive black holes is impacted by our observations.},

abstract = {Continuing our study of the role and evolution of accretion disc winds in the microquasar GRS 1915+105, we present high-resolution spectral variability analysis of the $\beta$ and $\gamma$ states with the Chandra High-Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer. By tracking changes in the absorption lines from the accretion disc wind, we find new evidence that radiation links the inner and outer accretion discs on a range of time-scales. As the central X-ray flux rises during the high-luminosity $\gamma$ state, we observe the progressive overionization of the wind. In the $\beta$ state, we argue that changes in the inner disc leading to the ejection of a transient 'baby jet' also quench the highly ionized wind from the outer disc. Our analysis reveals how the state, structure and X-ray luminosity of the inner accretion disc all conspire to drive the formation and variability of highly ionized accretion disc winds. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors MNRAS {\textcopyright} 2012 RAS.},

The inner disk appears slightly truncated by comparison with a previous high/soft state (HSS) of this source, even by taking into account energetic coupling between the disk and corona. The spectra do not show the Doppler-shifted emission lines indicating baryonic jets that were seen four days previously in an XMM-Newton observation, despite the source being in a similar state. There are no significant absorption lines from highly ionized iron ions. We also observed 4U 1630-47 in the HSS simultaneously with Suzaku and NuSTAR in an early epoch of the 2015 outburst. All Suzaku spectra in the HSS show variable iron-K absorption line features. We find that the ionization state of the disk wind rapidly increased when the continuum showed significant spectral hardening. This behavior is consistent with that expected from a thermally driven wind.},

@article{Martocchia2006_GRS1915+105_winds_XMM_2004,
abstract = {Two XMM-Newton observations of the black-hole binary GRS 1915+105 were triggered in 2004 (April 17 and 21), during a long "plateau" state of the source. We analyzed the data collected with EPIC-pn in timing and burst modes, respectively. Reflection Grating Spectrometers were used only on April 21st. The source 2-10 keV flux is ∼0.6 (unabsorbed: 0.9 ÷ 1.1) × 10-8 in cgs units. While the light curves show only small amplitude variations (a few percent) at timescales longer than a few seconds, a QPO is seen at about 0.6 Hz - as expected in $\chi$ variability modes of GRS 1915+105, when the phenomenological correlation with the source flux is taken into account - possibly with a harmonic signal at 1.2 Hz. The pn spectrum is well fitted without invoking thermal disk emission, on the basis of four main components: a primary one (either a simple power law or thermal Comptonization models), absorbed by cold matter with abundances different than those of standard ISM; reprocessing from an ionized disk; emission and absorption lines; and a soft X-ray excess at ∼1 keV. However, the last is not confirmed by the RGS spectra, whose difference from the EPIC-pn ones lacks a fully satisfactory explanation. If real, the soft X-ray excess may be due to reflection from an optically thin, photoionized disk wind; in this case it may lead to a way to disentangle intrinsic from interstellar absorption. {\textcopyright} ESO 2006.},

For each observation, we produced light curves and color-color diagrams. We classified the observations in 12 separate classes, based on their count rate and color characteristics. From the analysis of these classes, we reduced the variability of the source to transitions between three basic states: a hard state corresponding to the non-observability of the innermost parts of the accretion disk, and two softer states with a fully observable disk. These two soft states represent different temperatures of the accretion disk, related to different local values of the accretion rate. The transitions between these states can be extremely fast. The source moves between these three states following certain patterns and avoiding others, giving rise to a relatively large but limited number of variability classes. These results are the first step towards a linking of the properties of this exceptional source with standard black-hole systems and with accretion disk models.},

@article{Neilsen2018_GRS1915+105_wind_NICER,
abstract = {The bright, erratic black hole X-ray binary GRS 1915+105 has long been a target for studies of disk instabilities, radio/infrared jets, and accretion disk winds, with implications that often apply to sources that do not exhibit its exotic X-ray variability. With the launch of NICER, we have a new opportunity to study the disk wind in GRS 1915+105 and its variability on short and long timescales. Here we present our analysis of 39 NICER observations of GRS 1915+105 collected during five months of the mission data validation and verification phase, focusing on Fe XXV and Fe XXVI absorption. We report the detection of strong Fe XXVI in 32 (>80\%) of these observations, with another four marginal detections; Fe XXV is less common, but both likely arise in the well-known disk wind. We explore how the properties of this wind depends on broad characteristics of the X-ray lightcurve: mean count rate, hardness ratio, and fractional RMS variability. The trends with count rate and RMS are consistent with an average wind column density that is fairly steady between observations but varies rapidly with the source on timescales of seconds. The line dependence on spectral hardness echoes known behavior of disk winds in outbursts of Galactic black holes; these results clearly indicate that NICER is a powerful tool for studying black hole winds.},

@article{Ueda2009_GRS1915+105_wind_2007,
abstract = {We present the results from simultaneous Chandra HETGS and Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) observations of the microquasar GRS 1915+105 in its quasi-stable "soft state" (or State A) performed on 2007 August 14, several days after the state transition from "hard state" (State C). The X-ray flux increased with spectral hardening around the middle of the Chandra observation, after which the 67 Hz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) became significant. The HETGS spectra reveal at least 32 narrow absorption lines from highly ionized ions including Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, whose features are the deepest among those ever observed with Chandra from this source. By fitting to the absorption-line profiles by Voigt functions, we find that the absorber has outflow velocities of ≈150 and ≈500 km s-1 with a line-of-sight velocity dispersion of ≈70 and ≈200 km s-1 for the Si xiv and Fe xxvi ions, respectively. The larger velocity and its dispersion in heavier ions indicate that the wind has a nonuniform dynamical structure along the line of sight. The location of the absorber is estimated at ∼(1-3)×105rg (where rg is the gravitational radius) from the source, consistent with thermally and/or radiation-driven winds. By taking into account narrow spectral features detected with Chandra, the continuum spectra obtained with RXTE in the 3-25 keV band can be well described with a thermal Comptonization with an electron temperature of ≈4 keV and an optical depth of ≈5 from seed photons from the standard disk extending down to (4-7)rg. In this interpretation, most of the radiation energy is produced in the Comptonization corona, which completely covers the inner part of the disk. A broad (1$\sigma$ width of≈0.2 keV) iron-K emission line and a smeared edge feature are detected, which can be explained by reflection from the accretion disk at radii larger than 400rg when an emissivity power law index of-3 is assumed.},

@article{Higginbottom2018_GROJ1655-40_wind_thermal,
abstract = {Essentially all low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in the soft state appear to drive powerful equatorial disc winds. A simple mechanism for driving such outflows involves X-ray heating of the top of the disc atmosphere to the Compton temperature. Beyond the Compton radius, the thermal speed exceeds the escape velocity, and mass-loss is inevitable. Here, we present the first coupled radiation-hydrodynamic simulation of such thermally driven disc winds. The main advance over previous modelling efforts is that the frequency-dependent attenuation of the irradiating SED is taken into account. We can therefore relax the approximation that the wind is optically thin throughout which is unlikely to hold in the crucial acceleration zone of the flow. The main remaining limitations of our simulations are connected to our treatment of optically thick regions. Adopting parameters representative of the wind-driving LMXB GRO J1655-40, our radiation-hydrodynamic model yields a mass-loss rate that is ≃5 × lower than that suggested by pure hydrodynamic, optically thin models. This outflow rate still represents more than twice the accretion rate and agrees well with the mass-loss rate inferred from Chandra/HETG observations of GRO J1655-40 at a time when the system had a similar luminosity to that adopted in our simulations. The Fe XXV and Fe XXVI Lyman a absorption line profiles observed in this state are slightly stronger than those predicted by our simulations but the qualitative agreement between observed and simulated outflow properties means that thermal driving is a viable mechanism for powering the disc winds seen in soft-state LMXBs.},

@article{Balakrishnan2020_GROJ1655-40_wind_swift_2005,
abstract = {Chandra obtained two High Energy Transmission Grating (HETG) spectra of the stellar-mass black hole GRO J1655-40 during its 2005 outburst, revealing a rich and complex disk wind. Soon after its launch, the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory began monitoring the same outburst. Some X-ray Telescope (XRT) observations were obtained in a mode that makes it impossible to remove strong Mn calibration lines, so the Fe K-alpha line region in the spectra was previously neglected. However, these lines enable a precise calibration of the energy scale, facilitating studies of the absorption-dominated disk wind and its velocity shifts. Here, we present fits to 15 Swift/XRT spectra, revealing variability and evolution in the outflow. The data strongly point to a magnetically driven disk wind: both the higher velocity (e.g., v $\sim$ 10^4 km/s) and lower velocity (e.g., v $\sim$ 10^3 km/s) wind components are typically much faster than is possible for thermally driven outflows (v < 200 km/s), and photoionization modeling yields absorption radii that are two orders of magnitude below the Compton radius that defines the typical inner extent of thermal winds. Moreover, correlations between key wind parameters yield an average absorption measure distribution (AMD) that is consistent with magnetohydrodynamic wind models. We discuss our results in terms of recent observational and theoretical studies of black hole accretion disks and outflows, and future prospects.},

We present synthetic spectral models which can be used to constrain these element abundances and other parameters describing the outflow from the warm absorber in this object. We present results of fitting to the spectrum using various tools and techniques, including automated line fitting, phenomenological models, and photoionization modeling. We show that the behavior of the curves of growth of lines from H-like and Li-like ions indicate that the lines are either saturated or affected by filling-in from scattered or a partially covered continuum source. We confirm the conclusion of previous work by Miller et al., which shows that the ionization conditions are not consistent with wind driving due to thermal expansion. The spectrum provides the opportunity to measure abundances for several elements not typically observable in the X-ray band. These show a pattern of enhancement for iron peak elements, and solar or subsolar values for elements lighter than calcium. Models show that this is consistent with enrichment by a core-collapse supernova. We discuss the implications of these values for the evolutionary history of this system. {\textcopyright} 2009.

But this exotic wind represents just one piece of the puzzle in this outburst, as its presence coincides with an extremely soft and curved X-ray continuum spectrum, remarkable X-ray variability (Uttley \& Klein-Wolt), and a bright, unexpected optical/infrared blackbody component that varies on the orbital period. Focusing on the X-ray continuum and the optical/infrared/UV spectral energy distribution, we argue that the unusual features of this "hypersoft state" are natural consequences of a super-Eddington Compton-thick wind from the disk: the optical/infrared blackbody represents the cool photosphere of a dense, extended outflow, while the X-ray emission is explained as Compton scattering by the relatively cool, optically thick wind. This wind obscures the intrinsic luminosity of the inner disk, which we suggest may have been at or above the Eddington limit.},

We report here that semi-analytical, self-similar magnetohydrodynamic wind models that have successfully accounted for the X-ray absorber properties of supermassive black holes 5,6 also offer a good fit to the high-resolution X-ray spectrum of the accreting stellar-mass black hole GRO J1655-40. This provides an explicit theoretical argument of their magnetohydrodynamic origin (aligned with earlier observational claims) 7 and supports the notion of a universal magnetic structure of the observed winds across all known black hole sizes.},

@article{Tomaru2022_GROJ1655-40_wind_thermal,
abstract = {Black hole accretion discs can produce powerful outflowing plasma (disc winds), seen as blue-shifted absorption lines in stellar and supermassive systems. These winds in quasars have an essential role in controlling galaxy formation across cosmic time, but there is no consensus on how these are physically launched. A single unique observation of a stellar-mass black hole GRO J1655−40 was used to argue that magnetic driving was the only viable mechanism and motivated unified models of magnetic winds in both binaries and quasars. The alternative, X-ray heating (thermal-radiative wind), was ruled out for the low observed luminosity by the high wind density estimated from an absorption line of a metastable level of Fe XXII. Here, we reanalyse these data using a photoionization code that includes cascades from radiative excitation as well as collisions in populating the metastable level. The cascade reduces the inferred wind density by more than an order of magnitude. The derived column is also optically thick, so the source is intrinsically more luminous than observed. We show that a thermal-radiative wind model calculated from a radiation hydrodynamic simulation matches well with the data. We revisit the previous magnetic wind solution and show that this is also optically thick, leading to a larger source luminosity. However, unlike the thermal-radiative wind, it struggles to reproduce the overall ion population at the required density. These results remove the requirement for a magnetic wind in these data and remove the basis of the self-similar unified magnetic wind models extrapolated to quasar outflows.},

@article{Neilsen2012_GROJ1655-40_wind_magnetic,
abstract = {During its 2005 outburst, GRO J1655-40 was observed twice with the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer; the second observation revealed a spectrum rich with ionized absorption lines from elements ranging from O to Ni, indicative of an outflow too dense and too ionized to be driven by radiation or thermal pressure. To date, this spectrum is the only definitive evidence of an ionized wind driven off the accretion disk by magnetic processes in a black hole X-ray binary. Here we present our detailed spectral analysis of the first Chandra observation, nearly three weeks earlier, in which the only signature of the wind is the Fe XXVI absorption line. Comparing the broadband X-ray spectra via photoionization models, we argue that the differences in the Chandra spectra cannot possibly be explained by the changes in the ionizing spectrum, which implies that the properties of the wind cannot be constant throughout the outburst. We explore physical scenarios for the changes in the wind, which we suggest may begin as a hybrid MHD/thermal wind, but evolves over the course of weeks into two distinct outflows with different properties. We discuss the implications of our results for the links between the state of the accretion flow and the presence of transient disk winds. {\textcopyright} 2012. The American Astronomical Society.

@article{Lamer2021_MAXIJ1348-630_distance,
abstract = {We report the discovery of a giant dust scattering ring around the Black Hole transient MAXI J1348-630 with SRG/eROSITA during its first X-ray all-sky survey. During the discovery observation in February 2020, the ring had an outer diameter of 1.3 deg, growing to 1.6 deg by the time of the second all-sky survey scan in August 2020. This makes the new dust ring by far the largest X-ray scattering ring observed so far. Dust scattering halos, in particular the rings found around transient sources, provide an opportunity to make precise distance measurements towards the original X-ray sources. We combine data from SRG/eROSITA, XMM-Newton, MAXI, and Gaia to measure the geometrical distance of MAXI J1348-630. The Gaia data place the scattering dust at a distance of 2050 pc. Based on the measured time lags and the geometry of the ring we find MAXI J1348-630 at a distance of 3390 pc with a statistical uncertainty of only 1.1\% and a systematic uncertainty of 10\% caused mainly by the parallax offset of Gaia. This result makes MAXI J1348-630 one of the black hole transients with the most accurately determined distances. The new distance leads to a revised mass estimate for the black hole of 11 ± 2 M{\^{a}}{\v{S}} . The transition to the soft state during the outburst occurred when the bolometric luminosity of MAXI J1348-630 reached 1.7\% of its Eddington luminosity.},

abstract = {The multi-wavelength outburst activity in the recently discovered X-ray binary transient MAXI J1348-630 has sparked a great deal of controversy about the characteristics of this binary and questions around whether the source contains a black hole (BH). Here, we present the results of our analysis of the outburst of MAXI J1348-630 using Swift/XRT data. We find that energy spectra in all spectral states can be modeled using a combination of Comptonization and Gaussian iron-line components. In addition, we show that the X-ray photon index, -; is correlated with the mass accretion rate, M. We find that - increases monotonically with M from the low-hard state to the high-soft state, and then becomes saturated at - $\Gamma$ 3. This index behavior is similar to that exhibited by a number of other BH candidates. This result represents observational evidence of the presence of a BH in MAXI J1348-630.We also show that the value of - is correlated with the quasi periodic oscillation frequency, $\nu$L. Based on this correlation, we applied a scaling method to estimate a BH mass of 14:8 ± 0:9M⊙, using the well-studied BH binary XTE J1550-564 as a reference source. The recent discovery of a giant dust scattering ring around MAXI J1348-630 by SRG/eROSITA has refined distance estimates to this X-ray source. With this distance, we were able to estimate the disk inclination i = (65 ±7)° using the scaling technique for the correlation between - and normalization proportional to M. We detected a specific behavior of the disk seed photon temperature, kTs, immediately before the outburst: kTs initially decreases from 0.4 to 0.2 keV and increases only after the source transits to the outburst rise-maximum phase. An initial decrease in kTs occurred simultaneously with an increase in the illumination fraction, f . We interpreted this effect in terms of the bulk motion Comptonization model. At the start of the outburst, the Compton cloud (or corona) is very extended and, thus, the seed photons injected to the corona from the relatively far-away disk region, where kTs is about 0.2-0.4 keV. While M increases (or luminosity increases), the corona contracts, thus increasing the seed photon temperature, kTs. It is possible that such a decrease in kTs occurring simultaneously with an increase in the illumination fraction, f; can be considered a signature of the readiness of a BH object to go into an outburst phase.},

abstract = {<i>Context.<i/> GRS 1915+105 being one of the brightest transient black hole binaries (BHBs) in the X-rays offers a unique testbed for the study of the connection between accretion and ejection mechanisms in BHBs. In particular, this source can be used to study the accretion disc wind and its dependence on the state changes in BHBs.<i>Aims.<i/> Our aim is to investigate the origin and geometry of the accretion disc wind in GRS 1915+105. This study will provide a basis for planning future observations with the X-ray Imaging Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM), and may also provide important parameters for estimating the polarimetric signal with the upcoming Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE).<i>Methods.<i/> We analysed the spectra of GRS 1915+105 in the soft <i>ϕ<i/> and hard <i>$\chi$<i/> classes using the high-resolution spectroscopy offered by <i>Chandra<i/> HETGS. In the soft state, we find a series of wind absorption lines that follow a non-linear dependence of velocity width, velocity shift, and equivalent width with respect to ionisation, indicating a multiple component or stratified outflow. In the hard state we find only a faint Fe XXVI absorption line. We model the absorption lines in both the states using a dedicated magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) wind model to investigate a magnetic origin of the wind and to probe the cause of variability in the observed line flux between the two states.<i>Conclusions.<i/> The MHD disc wind model provides a good fit for both states, indicating the possibility of a magnetic origin of the wind. The multiple ionisation components of the wind are well characterised as a stratification of the same magnetic outflow. We find that the observed variability in the line flux between soft and hard states cannot be explained by photo-ionisation alone but is most likely due to a large (three orders of magnitude) increase in the wind density. We find the mass outflow rate of the wind to be comparable to the accretion rate, suggesting an intimate link between accretion and ejection processes that lead to state changes in BHBs.},

@article{Miller2012_H1743-322_wind_obs,
abstract = {X-ray disk winds are detected in spectrally soft, disk-dominated phases of stellar-mass black hole outbursts. In contrast, compact, steady, relativistic jets are detected in spectrally hard states that are dominated by non-thermal X-ray emission. Although these distinctive outflows appear to be almost mutually exclusive, it is possible that a disk wind persists in hard states but cannot be detected via X-ray absorption lines owing to very high ionization. Here, we present an analysis of a deep, 60 ks Chandra/HETGS observation of the black hole candidate H 1743-322 in the low/hard state. The spectrum shows no evidence of a disk wind, with tight limits, and within the range of ionizing flux levels that were measured in prior Chandra observations wherein a wind was clearly detected. In H1743-322, at least, disk winds are actually diminished in the low/hard state, and disk winds and jets are likely state dependent and anti-correlated. These results suggest that although the launching radii of winds and jets may differ by orders of magnitude, they may both be tied to a fundamental property of the inner accretion flow, such as the mass accretion rate and/or the magnetic field topology of the disk. We discuss these results in the context of disk winds and jets in other stellar-mass black holes, and possible launching mechanisms for black hole outflows. {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {High inclination black hole X-ray binaries exhibit blueshifted ionized absorption lines from disk winds, whose launching mechanism is still in debate. The lines are predominantly observed in the high/soft state and disappear in the low/hard state, anti-correlated with the jet. We have tested if the thermal winds, which are driven by the irradiation of the outer disk by the X-rays from the inner disk, can explain these observed properties or whether we need a magnetic switch between jet and wind. We use analytic thermal-radiative wind models to predict the column density, ionisation parameter and velocity of the wind given the broadband continuum shape and luminosity determined from RXTE monitoring. We use these to simulate the detailed photo-ionised absorption features predicted at epochs where there are Chandra high resolution spectra. These include low/hard, high/soft and very high states. The model was found to well reproduce the observed lines in the high/soft state, and also successfully predicts their disappearance in the low/hard state. However, the simplest version of the thermal wind model also predicts that there should be strong features observed in the very high state, which are not seen in the data. Nonetheless, we show this is consistent with thermal winds when we include self-shielding by the irradiated inner disk atmosphere. These results indicate that the evolution of observed wind properties in different states during outbursts in H 1743-322 can be explained by the thermal wind model and does not require magnetic driving.},

abstract = {Blueshifted absorption lines are seen in high inclination black hole binary systems in their disc dominated states, showing these power an equatorial disc wind. While some contribution from magnetic winds remain a possibility, thermal and thermal-radiative winds are expected to be present. We show results from radiation hydrodynamic simulations which show that the additional radiation force from atomic features (bound-free and lines) are important along with electron scattering. Together, these increase the wind velocity at high inclinations, so that they quantitatively match the observations in H 1743-322, unlike purely thermal winds which are too slow. We highlight the role played by shadowing of the outer disc from the (sub grid) inner disc Compton heated layer, and show that the increase in shadow from the higher Compton temperature after the spectral transition to the hard state leads to strong suppression of the wind. Thermal-radiative winds explain all of the spectral features (and their disappearance) in this simplest wind system and magnetic winds play only a minor role. We speculate that thermal-radiative winds can explain all the spectral features seen in the more complex (larger disc size) binaries, GRO J1655-40 and GRS 1915+105, without requiring magnetic winds.},

abstract = { We analyze three prototypical black hole X-ray binaries, 4U 1630–472, GRO J1655–40, and H1743–322, in an effort to systematically understand the intrinsic state transition of the observed accretion disk winds between wind-on and wind-off states by utilizing state-of-the-art Chandra/HETGS archival data from multi-epoch observations. We apply our magnetically driven wind models in the context of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) calculations to constrain (1) their global density slope ( p ), (2) their density ( n 17 ) at the foot point of the innermost launching radius, and (3) the abundances of heavier elements ( A Fe,S,Si ). Incorporating the MHD winds into xstar photoionization calculations in a self-consistent manner, we create a library of synthetic absorption spectra given the observed X-ray continua. Our analysis clearly indicates a characteristic bimodal transition of multi-ion X-ray winds; i.e., the wind density gradient is found to steepen (from p ∼ 1.2–1.4 to ∼1.4–1.5) while its density normalization declines as the source transitions from the wind-on to the wind-off state. The model implies that the ionized wind remains physically present even in the wind-off state, despite its apparent absence in the observed spectra. Supersolar abundances for heavier elements are also favored. Our global multi-ion wind models, taking into account soft X-ray ions as well as Fe K absorbers, show that the internal wind condition plays an important role in wind transitions besides photoionization changes. Simulated XRISM/Resolve and Athena/X-IFU spectra are presented to demonstrate a high fidelity of the multi-ion wind model for a better understanding of these powerful ionized winds in the coming decades. },

We appropriately take into account the effects of dust scattering to accurately analyze the X-ray spectra. The time-averaged spectra in the 1-200 keV band are dominated by a hard power-law component of a photon index of ≈1.6 with a high-energy cutoff at ≈60 keV, which is well described with the Comptonization of the disk emission by the hot corona. We estimate the inner disk radius from the multi-color disk component, and find that it is 1.3-2.3 times larger than the radius in the high/soft state. This suggests that the standard disk was not extended to the innermost stable circular orbit. A reflection component from the disk is detected with R = $\Omega$/2$\pi$ ≈ 0.6 ($\Omega$ is the solid angle). We also successfully estimate the stable disk component independent of the time-averaged spectral modeling by analyzing short-term spectral variability on a ∼1 s timescale. A weak low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation at 0.1-0.2 Hz is detected, whose frequency is found to correlate with the X-ray luminosity and photon index. This result may be explained by the evolution of the disk truncation radius. {\textcopyright} 2014. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The black hole candidate (BHC) X-ray transient 4U 1630?47 continuously produced strong X-ray emission for more than 2 years during its 2002–2004 outburst, which is one of the brightest and longest outbursts ever seen from this source. We use more than 300 observations made with the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) to study the source throughout the outburst, along with hard X-ray images from the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL), which are critical for interpreting the RXTE data in this crowded field. The source exhibits extreme behaviors, which can be interpreted as an indication that the system luminosity approaches the Eddington limit. For 15 observations, fitting the spectral continuum with a disk-blackbody plus power-law model results in measured inner disk temperatures between 2.7 and 3.8 keV, and such temperatures are only rivaled by the brightest BHC systems, such as GRS 1915+105 and XTE J1550?564. If the high temperatures are caused by the dominance of electron scattering opacity in the inner regions of the accretion disk, it is theoretically required that the source luminosity be considerably higher than 20\% of the Eddington limit.We detect a variety of high-amplitude variability, including hard 10–100 s flares, which peak at levels as much as 2–3 times higher than nonflare levels. This flaring occurs at the highest disk luminosities in a regime in which the source deviates from the Ldisk / T 4 in relationship that is seen at lower luminosities, possibly suggesting that we are seeing transitions between a Shakura \& Sunyaev disk and a ‘‘slim'' disk, which is predicted to occur at very high mass accretion rates. The X-ray properties in 2002–2004 are significantly different from those seen during the 1998 outburst, which is the only outburst with detected radio jet emission. Our results support the ‘‘jet line'' concept recently advanced by Fender and coworkers. Our study allows for a test of the quantitativeMcClintock&Remillard spectral state definitions, and we find that these definitions alone do not provide a complete description of the outburst. Finally, for several of the observations, the high-energy emission is dominated by the nearby sources IGR J16320–4751 and IGR J16358–4726, and we provide information on when these sources were bright and on the nature of their energy spectra.

abstract = {We studied a time history of X-ray spectral states of a black-hole candidate, 4U 1630-47, utilizing data from a number of monitoring observations with the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer over 1996-2004. These observations covered five outbursts of 4U 1630-47, and recorded typical features of the high/soft states. The spectra in the high/soft states can be classified into three states. The first state is explained by a concept of the standard accretion disk picture. The second appears in the very high state, where a dominant hard component is seen and the disk radius apparently becomes too small. These phenomena are explained by the effect of inverse Compton scattering of disk photons, as shown by Kubota, Makishima, and Ebisawa (2001, ApJ, 560, L147) for GRO J1655-40. The third shows that the disk luminosity varies in proportion to Tin2, rather than Tin4, where T in is the inner-disk temperature. This state suggests an optically-thick and advection-dominated slim disk, as given by Kubota and Makishima (2004, ApJ, 601, 428) for XTE J1550-564. The second and third states appear, with good reproducibility, when Tin and the total X-ray luminosity are higher than 1.2 keV and ∼ 2.5 × 1038(D/10 kpc)2[cos$\theta$/(1/√3)]-1 ergs-1, respectively, where D is the distance to the object and $\theta$ is the inclination angle to the disk. The results suggest that these spectral states commonly appear among black-hole binaries under high accretion rates. {\textcopyright} 2005. Astronomical Society of Japan.},

abstract = {We observed the Galactic black hole GX 339-4 with the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) for 75 ksec during the decline of its 2002-2003 outburst. The sensitivity of this observation provides an unprecedented glimpse of a Galactic black hole at about a tenth of the luminosity of the outburst peak. The continuum spectrum is well described by a model consisting of multicolor disk blackbody (kT = 0.6 keV) and power-law (Gamma = 2.5) components. X-ray reflection models yield improved fits. A strong, relativistic Fe K-alpha emission line is revealed, indicating that the inner disk extends to the innermost stable circular orbit. The breadth of the line is sufficient to suggest that GX 339-4 may harbor a black hole with significant angular momentum. Absorption lines from H-like and He-like O, and He-like Ne and Mg are detected, as well as lines which are likely due to Ne II and Ne III. The measured line properties make it difficult to associate the absorption with the coronal phase of the interstellar medium. A scenario wherein the absorption lines are due to an intrinsic AGN-like warm-absorber geometry -- perhaps produced by a disk wind in an extended disk-dominated state -- may be more viable. We compare our results to Chandra observations of the Galactic black hole candidate XTE J1650-500, and discuss our findings in terms of prominent models for Galactic black hole accretion flows and connections to supermassive black holes.},

@article{Shidatsu2013_MAXIJ1305-704_wind_soft_hard_Swift_Suzaku,
abstract = {We report the results from X-ray studies of the newly discovered black hole candidate MAXI J1305-704 based on Suzaku and Swift observations in the low/hard and high/soft states, respectively. The long Suzaku observation shows two types of clear absorption dips, both of which recur on a dip interval of 9.74 ± 0.04 hr, which we identify with the orbital period. There is also partially ionized absorption in the nondip (persistent) emission in both the high/soft state and, very unusually, the low/hard state. However, this absorption (in both states) has substantially lower ionization than that seen in other high inclination systems, where the material forms a homogeneous disk wind. Here instead the absorption is most likely associated with clumpy, compact structures associated with the dipping material, which we see uniquely in this source likely because we view it at a very large inclination angle. A large inclination angle is also favored, together with a low black hole mass, to explain the high disk temperature seen in the fairly low luminosity high/soft state, as Doppler boosting enhances the disk temperature at high inclination. The disk radius inferred from these data is significantly smaller than that of the soft component seen in the low/hard state, supporting models where the disk is truncated at low luminosities. We find, however, that the lack of variability power on timescales of ∼50 s in the Suzaku low/hard state data is difficult to explain, even with a low-mass black hole. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {We performed simultaneous observations with Suzaku and NuSTAR of the Galactic black hole binary 4U 1630−47 in the high/soft state (HSS) during the 2015 outburst. To compare our results with those observed in the HSS at lower luminosities, we reanalyze the Suzaku data taken during the 2006 outburst. The continuum can be well explained by thermal disk emission and a hard power-law tail. All spectra show strong iron-K absorption line features, suggesting that a disk wind is always developed in the HSS. We find that the degree of ionization of the wind dramatically increased at the brightest epoch in 2015, when the continuum became harder. Detailed XSTAR simulations show that this cannot be explained solely by an increase of the photoionization flux. Instead, we show that the observed behavior in the HSS is consistent with a theory of thermally driven disk winds, where the column density and the ionization parameter of the disk wind are proportional to the luminosity and the Compton temperature, respectively.},

abstract = {We present the X-ray spectral and timing analysis of the transient black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-47, observed with the AstroSat, Chandra and MAXI space missions during its soft X-ray outburst in 2016. The outburst, from the rising phase until the peak, is neither detected in hard X-rays (15-50 keV) by the Swift/BAT nor in radio. Such non-detection along with the source behavior in the hardness-intensity and color-color diagrams obtained using MAXI data confirm that both Chandra and AstroSat observations were performed during the high soft spectral state. The High Energy Grating (HEG) spectrum from the Chandra high-energy transmission grating spectrometer (HETGS) shows two strong, moderately blueshifted absorption lines at 6.705$_{-0.002}^{+0.002}$ keV and 6.974$_{-0.003}^{+0.004}$ keV, which are produced by Fe XXV and Fe XXVI in a low-velocity ionized disk wind. The corresponding outflow velocity is determined to be 366$\pm$56 km/s. Separate spectral fits of Chandra/HEG, AstroSat/SXT+LAXPC and Chandra/HEG + AstroSat/SXT+LAXPC data show that the broadband continuum can be well described with a relativistic disk-blackbody model, with the disk flux fraction of $\sim 0.97$. Based on the best-fit continuum spectral modeling of Chandra, AstroSat and Chandra+AstroSat joint spectra and using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations, we constrain the spectral hardening factor at 1.56$^{+0.14}_{-0.06}$ and the dimensionless black hole spin parameter at 0.92 $\pm$ 0.04 within the 99.7% confidence interval. Our conclusion of a rapidly-spinning black hole in 4U 1630-47 using the continuum spectrum method is in agreement with a previous finding applying the reflection spectral fitting method.},

The composition of the relativistic jets powered by black holes is a notable unsolved question in astrophysics: are they leptonic (composed essentially of electrons, positrons and neutrinos) or baryonic (composed of and protons and neutrons)? Mar{\'{i}}a D{\'{i}}az Trigo et al. report the detection of Doppler-shifted X-ray emission lines from the black hole candidate X-ray binary, 4U 1630-47, coincident with the reappearance of radio emission from the jets of the source. They argue that these lines arise in a jet with a velocity of 0.66 times the speed of light, thereby establishing the presence of baryons in the jet. Such baryonic jets are more likely to be powered by the accretion disc than by the spin of the black hole. Accreting black holes are known to power relativistic jets, both in stellar-mass binary systems and at the centres of galaxies. The power carried away by the jets, and, hence, the feedback they provide to their surroundings, depends strongly on their composition. Jets containing a baryonic component should carry significantly more energy than electron–positron jets. Energetic considerations1,2 and circular-polarization measurements3 have provided conflicting circumstantial evidence for the presence or absence of baryons in jets, and the only system in which they have been unequivocally detected is the peculiar X-ray binary SS 433 (refs 4, 5). Here we report the detection of Doppler-shifted X-ray emission lines from a more typical black-hole candidate X-ray binary, 4U 1630-47, coincident with the reappearance of radio emission from the jets of the source. We argue that these lines arise from baryonic matter in a jet travelling at approximately two-thirds the speed of light, thereby establishing the presence of baryons in the jet. Such baryonic jets are more likely to be powered by the accretion disk6 than by the spin of the black hole7, and if the baryons can be accelerated to relativistic speeds, the jets should be strong sources of $\gamma$-rays and neutrino emission.},

They interpreted these lines as indicative of a baryonic jet launched by the accretion disk. Here we present a search for the same lines earlier in the same outburst using high-resolution X-ray spectra from the Chandra HETGS. While our observations (eight months prior to the XMM-Newton campaign) also coincide with detections of steep spectrum radio emission by the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we find no evidence for any relativistic X-ray emission lines. Indeed, despite 5 × brighter radio emission, our Chandra spectra allow us to place an upper limit on the flux in the blueshifted Fe XXVI line that is ≳ 20 × weaker than the line observed by D{\'{i}}az Trigo et al. We explore several scenarios that could explain our differing results, including variations in the geometry of the jet or a mass-loading process or jet baryon content that evolves with the accretion state of the black hole. We also consider the possibility that the radio emission arises in an interaction between a jet and the nearby interstellar medium, in which case the X-ray emission lines might be unrelated to the radio emission. {\textcopyright} 2014.

abstract = {We report on XMM-Newton observations of the black hole X-ray binary 4Ua' 1630-47 during its 2012-2013 outburst. The first five observations monitor the source as its luminosity increases across the high-soft state of accretion. In the sixth observation the source has made a transition to an "anomalous" state, characterised by a significant contribution of electron scattering. A thermally/radiatively driven disc wind is present in the first four observations, which becomes more photoionised as the luminosity increases with time. In the fifth observation, the wind is not observed any more as a consequence of strong photoionisation and the low sensitivity of this observation. This overall trend is then consistent with a fully ionised wind causing the electron scattering characteristic of the anomalous state in the sixth observation. A broad iron emission line co-exists with the absorption features from the wind in the first four observations but is not visible in the last two observations. We find that the changes in the state of the wind as measured from modelling the absorption features with a self-consistent warm absorber model are correlated to the changes in the broad iron line. When the latter is modelled with a reflection component we find that the reflection fraction decreases as the illumination increases. We propose that the changes in both the absorption and broad emission lines are caused by the increasing luminosity and temperature of the accretion disc along the soft state. Such changes ultimately enable the transition to a state where the wind is fully ionised and consequently Comptonisation plays a significant role.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of a short NuSTAR observation of the stellar-mass black hole and low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1630-472. Reflection from the inner accretion disk is clearly detected for the first time in this source, owing to the sensitivity of NuSTAR. With fits to the reflection spectrum, we find evidence for a rapidly spinning black hole, (1$\sigma$ statistical errors). However, archival data show that the source has relatively low radio luminosity. Recently claimed relationships between jet power and black hole spin would predict either a lower spin or a higher peak radio luminosity. We also report the clear detection of an absorption feature at 7.03 ± 0.03 keV, likely signaling a disk wind. If this line arises in dense, moderately ionized gas (log$\chi$ = 3.6-0.3+0.2) and is dominated by He-like Fe XXV, the wind has a velocity of v/c = 0.043-0.007+0.002(12900-2100600 km s-1). If the line is instead associated with a more highly ionized gas (), and is dominated by Fe XXVI, evidence of a blueshift is only marginal, after taking systematic errors into account. Our analysis suggests the ionized wind may be launched within 200-1100 Rg, and may be magnetically driven. {\textcopyright} 2014. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The mechanisms that drive disk winds are a window into the physical processes that underlie the disk. Stellar-mass black holes are an ideal setting in which to explore these mechanisms, in part because their outbursts span a broad range in mass accretion rate. We performed a spectral analysis of the disk wind found in six Chandra/HETG observations of the black hole candidate 4U$\sim$1630$-$472, covering a range of luminosities over two distinct spectral states. We modeled both wind absorption and extended wind re-emission components using PION, a self-consistent photoionized absorption model. In all but one case, two photoionization zones were required in order to obtain acceptable fits. Two independent constraints on launching radii, obtained via the ionization parameter formalism and the dynamical broadening of the re-emission, helped characterize the geometry of the wind. The innermost wind components ($r \simeq {10}^{2-3}$ $GM/{c}^{2}$) tend towards small volume filling factors, high ionization, densities up to $n \simeq {10}^{15-16} {\text{cm}}^{-3}$, and outflow velocities of $\sim 0.003c$. These small launching radii and large densities require magnetic driving, as they are inconsistent with numerical and analytical treatments of thermally driven winds. Outer wind components ($r \simeq {10}^{5}$ $GM/{c}^{2}$) are significantly less ionized and have filling factors near unity. Their larger launching radii, lower densities ($n \simeq {10}^{12} {\text{cm}}^{-3}$), and outflow velocities ($\sim 0.0007c$) are nominally consistent with thermally driven winds. The overall wind structure suggests that these components may also be part of a broader MHD outflow and perhaps better described as magneto-thermal hybrid winds.},

abstract = {We present the analysis of six Chandra X-ray high-resolution observations of the black hole low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1630-47 taken during its 2012-2013 outburst. Fe XXVI K $\alpha$, K $\beta$, Fe XXV K $\alpha$, K $\beta$, and Ca XX K $\alpha$ blueshifted absorption lines were identified in the first four observations, which correspond to soft accretion states. The remaining observations, associated to intermediate and possibly hard accretion states, do not show significant absorption features down to equivalent width of 1 eV for both Fe XXVI and Fe XXV. We inferred wind launching radii between 1.2 − 2.0 (10 12 cm/n) × 10 11 cm and column densities N(H) > 10 23 cm −2. In the first four observations, we found that thermal pressure is likely to be the dominant launching mechanism for the wind, although such conclusions depend on the assumed density. We used the spectral energy distributions obtained from our continuum modelling to compute thermal stability curves for all observations using the XSTAR photoionization code. We found that the absence of lines in the transitional state cannot be attributed to an evolution of the plasma caused by thermal instabilities derived from the change in the continuum spectrum. In contrast, the disappearance of the wind could indicate an acceleration of the flow or that the plasma has been exhausted during the soft state.},

@article{Seifina2014_4U1630-47_properties,
abstract = {We present the results of a comprehensive investigation on the evolution of spectral and timing properties of the Galactic black hole candidate 4U 1630--47 during its spectral transitions. In particular, we show how a scaling of the correlation of the photon index of the Comptonized spectral component Gamma with low frequency of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO), nu_L and mass accretion rate, $\dot M$ can be applied to the black hole mass and the inclination angle estimates. We analyze the transition episodes observed with the {\it Rossi} X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and BeppoSAX satellites. We find that the broadband X-ray energy spectra of 4U$\sim$1630--47 during all spectral states can be modeled by a combination of a thermal component, a Comptonized component and a red-skewed iron line component. We also establish that Gamma monotonically increases during transition from the low-hard state to the high-soft state and then saturates for high mass accretion rates. The index saturation levels vary for different transition episodes. Correlations of Gamma versus nu_L also shows saturation at Gamma $\sim$ 3. Gamma-Mdot and Gamma-nu_L correlations with their index saturation revealed in 4U$\sim$1630--47 are similar to those established in a number of other BHCs and can be considered as an observational evidence for the presence of a black hole in these sources. The scaling technique, which relies on XTE J1550--564, GRO 1655-40 and H 1743-322 as reference sources, allows us to evaluate a black hole mass in 4U$\sim$1630--47 yielding M_{BH}$\sim$10+/- 0.1 solar masses, and to constrain the inclination angle of i< 70 degrees.},

For the first time we present almost complete coverage of the outbursts which started in 1987, 1988 and 1996. We find that the outburst behaviour of 4U1630-47 is more complex than previously realized. The source shows outbursts with durations on the order of $\sim$100-200 days and sometimes intervals of long-term X-ray activity. The relatively short outbursts which occurred in 1987 and 1996 exhibited different colour behaviour: the outburst in 1987 showed softening of the X-ray spectrum, whereas the outburst in 1996 showed hardening of the X-ray spectrum, as the outbursts proceeded. The outburst which started in 1977 may have lasted for up to $\sim$10 months, whereas the outburst which started in 1988 showed activity for up to $\sim$2.4 years. Such long-term activity is reminiscent of that seen in GRS1716-249 and in the galactic superluminal sources GRS1915+105 and GROJ1655-40. We refine the outburst ephemeris of 4U\1630-47 and find that the outburst recurrence time scale may have changed from $\sim$600 days to $\sim$690 days between the 1984 and 1987 outbursts. If the recurrence interval of $\sim$690 days continues, the next outburst of 4U1630-47 is predicted to occur in 1998 January.},

@article{Motta2018_radio-loudness_inclination,
abstract = {Accreting stellar-mass black holes appear to populate two branches in a radio:X-ray luminosity plane. We have investigated the X-ray variability properties of a large number of black hole low-mass X-ray binaries, with the aim of unveiling the physical reasons underlying the radio-loud/radio-quiet nature of these sources, in the context of the known accretion-ejection connection. A reconsideration of the available radio and X-ray data from a sample of black hole X-ray binaries confirms that being radio-quiet is the more normal mode of behaviour for black hole binaries. In the light of this we chose to test, once more, the hypothesis that radio-loudness could be a consequence of the inclination of the X-ray binary. We compared the slope of the 'hard-line' (an approximately linear correlation between X-ray count rate and rms variability, visible in the hard states of active black holes), the orbital inclination, and the radio-nature of the sources of our sample. We found that high-inclination objects show steeper hard-lines than low-inclination objects, and tend to display a radio-quiet nature (with the only exception of V404 Cyg), as opposed to low-inclination objects, which appear to be radioloud(er). While in need of further confirmation, our results suggest that - contrary to what has been believed for years - the radio-loud/quiet nature of black-hole low-mass X-ray binaries might be an inclination effect, rather than an intrinsic source property. This would solve an important issue in the context of the inflow-outflow connection, thus providing significant constraints to the models for the launch of hard-state compact jets.},

This study is based on eight observations from the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and six observations from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory X-Ray Telescope (Swift/XRT) collected from 2019 November 19 to 2020 April 26 as the 3-79 keV source flux declined from 8.2e-10 to 1.4e-12 erg/cm^2/s. We see the source transition from a soft state with a strong disk-blackbody component to a hard state dominated by a power-law or thermal Comptonization component. NuSTAR provides the first reported coverage of MAXI J0637-430 above 10 keV, and these broadband spectra show that a two-component model does not provide an adequate description of the soft state spectrum. As such, we test whether blackbody emission from the plunging region could explain the excess emission. As an alternative, we test a reflection model that includes a physical Comptonization continuum. Finally, we also test a spectral component based on reflection of a blackbody illumination spectrum, which can be interpreted as a simple approximation to the reflection produced by returning disk radiation due to the bending of light by the strong gravity of the black hole. We discuss the physical implications of each scenario and demonstrate the value of constraining the source distance.},

abstract = {We present a new method to derive binary inclinations in quiescent black hole (BH) X-ray transients (XRTs), based on the depth of the trough (T) from double-peaked Ha emission profiles arising in accretion discs. We find that the inclination angle (i) is linearly correlated with T in phase-averaged spectra with sufficient orbital coverage (>$\sim$50 per cent) and spectral resolution, following i (deg)=93.5 x T +23.7. The correlation is caused by a combination of line opacity and local broadening, where a leading (excess broadening) component scales with the de-projected velocity of the outer disc. Interestingly, such scaling allows to estimate the fundamental ratio M1/Porb by simply resolving the intrinsic width of the double-peak profile. We apply the T-i correlation to derive binary inclinations for GRO J0422+32 and Swift J1357-0933, two BH XRTs where strong flickering activity has hindered determining their values through ellipsoidal fits to photometric light curves. Remarkably, the inclination derived for GRO J0422+32 (i=55.6+-4.1) implies a BH mass of 2.7+0.7-0.5 Msun thus placing it within the gap that separates BHs from neutron stars. This result proves that low-mass BHs exist in nature and strongly suggests that the so-called "mass gap" is mainly produced by low number statistics and possibly observational biases. On the other hand, we find that Swift J1357-0933 contains a 10.9+1.7-1.6 Msun BH seen nearly edge on (i=87.4+2.6-5.6 deg). Such extreme inclination, however, should be treated with caution since it relies on extrapolating the T-i correlation beyond i>$\sim$75 deg, where it has not yet been tested.},

abstract = {As one of the best-characterized stellar-mass black holes, with good measurements of its mass, distance, and inclination, V404 Cyg is the ideal candidate to study Eddington-limited accretion episodes. After a long quiescent period, V404 Cyg underwent a new outburst in 2015 June. We obtained two Chandra HETG exposures of 20 and 25 ks. Many strong emission lines are observed; the ratio of Si He-like triplet lines gives an estimate for the formation region distance of 4 ×1011 cm. A narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line is detected with an equivalent width greater than 1 keV in many epochs, signaling that we do not directly observe the central engine. Obscuration of the central engine and strong narrow emission lines signal that the outer disk may be illuminated, and its structure may help to drive the strong variability observed in V404 Cyg. In the highest flux phases, strong P-Cygni profiles consistent with a strong disk wind are observed, likely radiation or thermally driven as V404 Cyg approaches its Eddington limit. The kinetic power of this wind may be extremely high at >0.1 LBol.},

abstract = {MAXI J1535-571 is a Galactic black hole candidate X-ray binary that was discovered going into outburst in 2017 September. In this paper, we present comprehensive radio monitoring of this system using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), as well as the MeerKAT radio observatory, showing the evolution of the radio jet during its outburst. Our radio observations show the early rise and subsequent quenching of the compact jet as the outburst brightened and then evolved towards the soft state. We constrain the compact jet quenching factor to be more than 3.5 orders of magnitude. We also detected and tracked (for 303 days) a discrete, relativistically-moving jet knot that was launched from the system. From the motion of the apparently superluminal knot, we constrain the jet inclination (at the time of ejection) and speed to $\leq 45^{\circ}$ and $\geq0.69$c, respectively. Extrapolating its motion back in time, our results suggest that the jet knot was ejected close in time to the transition from the hard intermediate state to soft intermediate state. The launching event also occurred contemporaneously with a short increase in X-ray count rate, a rapid drop in the strength of the X-ray variability, and a change in the type-C quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) frequency that occurs $>$2.5 days before the first appearance of a possible type-B QPO.},

abstract = {We report results on the joint-fit of the NuSTAR and HXMT data for the black hole X-ray binary candidate MAXI J1535-571. The observations were obtained in 2017 when the source evolved through the hard, hard-intermediate, and soft-intermediate states over the rising phase of the outburst. After subtracting continuum components, X-ray reflection signatures are clearly showed in those observations. By modelling the relativistic reflection in detail, we find that the inner radius Rin is relatively stable with Rin 1.55Rg during the three states, which implies that the inner radius likely extends to the innermost stable circular orbit even in the bright hard state. When adopting Rin = RISCO, the spin parameter is constrained to be 0.985-0.004 +0.002 at 90 per cent confidence (statistical only). The best-fitting results reveal that the inclination of the inner accretion disc is ∼70-74 deg, which notably conflicts with the apparent orientation of the ballistic jet (≤45 deg). In addition, both the photon index and the electron temperature increase during the transition from hard to soft state. It seems that the corona evolves from dense low-temperature in the low/hard state to tenuous high-temperature after the state transition, which indicates that the state transition is accompanied by the evolution of the coronal properties.},

@article{Carotenuto2022_MAXIJ1348-630_i_jet,
abstract = {Black hole low mass X-ray binaries (BH LMXBs) can launch powerful outflows in the form of discrete ejecta. Observing the entire trajectory of these ejecta allows us to model their motion with great accuracy and this is essential for measuring their physical properties. In particular, observing the final deceleration phase, often poorly sampled, is fundamental to obtain a reliable estimate of the jet's energy. During its 2019/2020 outburst, the BH LMXB MAXI J1348-630 launched a single-sided radio-emitting jet that was detected at large scales after a strong deceleration due to the interaction with the interstellar medium (ISM). We successfully modelled the jet motion with a dynamical external shock model, which allowed us to constrain the jet initial Lorentz factor $\Gamma$ 0 = 1.85 +0.15-0.12, inclination angle $\theta$ = 29.3 -3.2+2.7 deg, and ejection date t\rm ej = 21.5 -3.0+1.8 (MJD-58500). Under simple assumptions on the jet opening angle and on the external ISM density, we find that the jet has a large initial kinetic energy E_0 = 4.6+20.0-3.4 × 1046 erg, far greater than what commonly measured for LMXBs from the jet's synchrotron emission. This implies that discrete ejecta radiate away only a small fraction of their total energy, which is instead transferred to the environment. The jet power estimate is larger than the simultaneous available accretion power, and we present several options to mitigate this discrepancy. We infer that MAXI J1348-630 is likely embedded in an ISM cavity with internal density $n = 0.0010 +0.0005-0.0003 cm-3$ and radius R c = 0.61+0.11-0.09 pc, which could have been produced by the system's previous activity, as proposed for other BH LMXBs.},

abstract = {MAXI J1348 630 is a low mass X-ray binary discovered in 2019 during a bright outburst. During this event, the system experienced both hard and soft states following the standard evolution. We present multi-epoch optical and near-infrared spectroscopy obtained with X-shooter at the Very Large Telescope. Our dataset includes spectra taken during the brightest phases of the outburst as well as the decay towards quiescence. We study the evolution of the main emission lines, paying special attention to the presence of features commonly associated with accretion disc winds, such as blueshifted absorptions, broad emission line wings and flat-top profiles. We find broad emission line wings in H$\alpha$ during the hard-to-soft transition and blueshifted absorption troughs at 500 km s 1 in H$\beta$, He I 5876, H$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$ during the bright soft-intermediate state. In addition, flat-top profiles are seen throughout the outburst. We interpret these observables as signatures of a cold (i.e., optical-to-infrared) accretion disc wind present in the system. We discuss the properties of the wind and compare them with those seen in other X-ray transients. In particular, the wind velocity that we observe is low when compared to those of other systems, which might be a direct consequence of the relatively low binary inclination, as suggested by several observables. This study strengthens the hypothesis that cold winds are a common feature in low mass X-ray binaries and that they can also be detected in low inclination objects via high-quality optical and infrared spectroscopy.},

abstract = {We present a spectral analysis of the Seyfert 1.8 ESO 113-G010 observed with XMM-Newton for 4 ks. The spectrum shows a soft excess below 0.7 keV and more interestingly a narrow emission Gaussian line at 5.4 keV (in its rest-frame), most probably originating from a redshifted iron Kor line. No significant line at or above 6.4 keV is found contrary to other objects showing redshifted lines, ruling out a strong blue-wing to the line profile. The line is detected at 99\% confidence, from performing Monte Carlo simulations which fully account for the range of energies where a narrow iron line is likely to occur. The energy of the line could indicate emission from relativistic (0.17-0.23c) ejected matter moving away from the observer, as proposed for Mrk 766 by Turner et al. (2004, ApJ, 603, 62). Alternatively, the emission from a narrow annulus at the surface of the accretion disk is unlikely due to the very small inclination angle (i.e. less than 10°) required to explain the narrow, redshifted line in this intermediate Seyfert galaxy. However emission from a small, localized hot-spot on the disk, occurring within a fraction of a complete disk orbit, could also explain the redshifted line. This scenario would be directly testable in a longer observation, as one would see significant variations in the energy and intensity of the line within an orbital timescale.},

Although there are many legitimate uses of these statistics, in some important cases it can be impossible to compute the correct false positive rate. For example, it has become common practice to use the LRT or the $F$ test for detecting a line in a spectral model or a source above background despite the lack of certain required regularity conditions. In these and other settings that involve testing a hypothesis that is on the boundary of the parameter space, {\it contrary to common practice, the nominal $\chi^2$ distribution for the LRT or the $F$ distribution for the $F$ test should not be used}. In this paper, we characterize an important class of problems where the LRT and the $F$ test fail and illustrate this non-standard behavior. We briefly sketch several possible acceptable alternatives, focusing on Bayesian posterior predictive probability-values. We present this method in some detail, as it is a simple, robust, and intuitive approach. This alternative method is illustrated using the gamma-ray burst of May 8, 1997 (GRB 970508) to investigate the presence of an Fe K emission line during the initial phase of the observation.},

@article{Buchner2014_BXA,
abstract = {Context. Aims. Active galactic nuclei are known to have complex X-ray spectra that depend on both the properties of the accreting super-massive black hole (e.g. mass, accretion rate) and the distribution of obscuring material in its vicinity (i.e. the "torus"). Often however, simple and even unphysical models are adopted to represent the X-ray spectra of AGN, which do not capture the complexity and diversity of the observations. In the case of blank field surveys in particular, this should have an impact on e.g. the determination of the AGN luminosity function, the inferred accretion history of the Universe and also on our understanding of the relation between AGN and their host galaxies. Methods. We develop a Bayesian framework for model comparison and parameter estimation of X-ray spectra. We take into account uncertainties associated with both the Poisson nature of X-ray data and the determination of source redshift using photometric methods. We also demonstrate how Bayesian model comparison can be used to select among ten different physically motivated X-ray spectral models the one that provides a better representation of the observations. This methodology is applied to X-ray AGN in the 4 Ms Chandra Deep Field South. Results. For the $\sim$350 AGN in that field, our analysis identifies four components needed to represent the diversity of the observed X-ray spectra: (1) an intrinsic power law; (2) a cold obscurer which reprocesses the radiation due to photo-electric absorption, Compton scattering and Fe-K fluorescence; (3) an unabsorbed power law associated with Thomson scattering off ionised clouds; and (4) Compton reflection, most noticeable from a stronger-than-expected Fe-K line. Simpler models, such as a photo-electrically absorbed power law with a Thomson scattering component, are ruled out with decisive evidence (B > 100). We also find that ignoring the Thomson scattering component results in underestimation of the inferred column density, NH, of the obscurer. Regarding the geometry of the obscurer, there is strong evidence against both a completely closed (e.g. sphere), or entirely open (e.g. blob of material along the line of sight), toroidal geometry in favour of an intermediate case. Conclusions. Despite the use of low-count spectra, our methodology is able to draw strong inferences on the geometry of the torus. Simpler models are ruled out in favour of a geometrically extended structure with significant Compton scattering. We confirm the presence of a soft component, possibly associated with Thomson scattering off ionised clouds in the opening angle of the torus. The additional Compton reflection required by data over that predicted by toroidal geometry models, may be a sign of a density gradient in the torus or reflection off the accretion disk. Finally, we release a catalogue of AGN in the CDFS with estimated parameters such as the accretion luminosity in the 2-10 keV band and the column density, NH, of the obscurer. {\textcopyright} ESO, 2014.},

After analysing the variations with orbital phase of the column density of each component, as well as those in the Fe and Ni fluorescence lines, we provide a physical interpretation for each spectral component. Meanwhile, the first two components are two aspects of the principal accretion component from the surface of the neutron star, the third component seems to be the X-ray light echo formed in the stellar wind of the companion. {\textcopyright} ESO, 2014.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of ionized X-ray disk winds found in the Fe K band of four stellar-mass black holes observed with Chandra, including 4U 1630-47, GRO J1655-40, H 1743-322, and GRS 1915+105. High-resolution photoionization grids were generated in order to model the data. Third-order gratings spectra were used to resolve complex absorption profiles into atomic effects and multiple velocity components. The Fe xxv line is found to be shaped by contributions from the intercombination line (in absorption), and the Fe xxvi line is detected as a spin-orbit doublet. The data require 2-3 absorption zones, depending on the source. The fastest components have velocities approaching or exceeding increasing mass outflow rates and wind kinetic power by orders of magnitude over prior single-zone models. The first-order spectra require re-emission from the wind, broadened by a degree that is loosely consistent with Keplerian orbital velocities at the photoionization radius. This suggests that disk winds are rotating with the orbital velocity of the underlying disk, and provides a new means of estimating launching radii - crucial to understanding wind driving mechanisms. Some aspects of the wind velocities and radii correspond well to the broad-line region in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), suggesting a physical connection. We discuss these results in terms of prevalent models for disk wind production and disk accretion itself, and implications for massive black holes in AGNs.},

abstract = {In this work, we present a spectral and temporal analysis of Swift/XRT and NuSTAR observations of GRS 1716-249 during its recent 2016-2017 outburst. This low-mass X-ray binary underwent an extraordinary outburst after a long quiescence of 23 yr, since its last major outburst in 1993. The source was observed over two different epochs during 2017 April 7 and 10. The best-fitting joint spectral fitting in the energy range 0.5-79.0 keV indicates that the spectrum is best described by relatively cold, weak disc blackbody emission, dominant thermal Comptonization emission, and a relativistically broadened fluorescent iron K $\alpha$ emission line. We observed a clear indication of a Compton hump around 30 keV. We also detected an excess feature of 1.3 keV. Assuming a lamp-post geometry of the corona, we constrained the inner disc radius for both observations to 11.92$^{+8.62}-{-11.92}$RISCO (i.e. an upper limit) and 10.39$^{+9.51}-{-3.02}$RISCO (where RISCO radius of the innermost stable circular orbit) for the first epoch (E1) and second epoch (E2), respectively. A significant (5$\sigma$) type C quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) at 1.20 ± 0.04 Hz is detected for the first time for GRS 1716-249, which drifts to 1.55 ± 0.04 Hz (6$\sigma$) at the end of the second observation. The derived spectral and temporal properties show a positive correlation between the QPO frequency and the photon index.},

abstract = {We present optical spectroscopy obtained with the GTC, VLT, and SALT telescopes during the decline of the 2016-2017 outburst of the black hole candidate GRS 1716-249 (Nova Oph 1993). Our 18-epoch data set spans 6 months and reveals that the observational properties of the main emission lines are very variable, even on time-scales of a few hours. Several epochs are characterized by P-Cyg (as well as flat-top and asymmetric) profiles in the H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, and He ii ($\lambda$4686) emission lines, implying the presence of an accretion disc wind, which is likely hot and dense. The wind's terminal velocity (∼2000 km s-1) is similar to that observed in other black hole X-ray transients. These lines also show transient and sharp red-shifted absorptions, taking the form of inverted P-Cyg profiles. We argue that these profiles can be explained by the presence of infalling material at ∼1300 km s-1. We propose a failed wind scenario to explain this inflow and discuss other alternatives, such as obscuration produced by an accretion-related structure (e.g. the gas stream) in a high inclination system.},

In this paper, we present comprehensive NICER, NuSTAR, Chandra, Swift, and MAXI observations of AT2019wey from $\sim$1 year prior to the discovery to the end of September 2020. AT2019wey appeared as a $\sim$1 mCrab source and stayed at this flux density for several months, displaying a hard X-ray spectrum that can be modeled as a power-law with photon index Gamma$\sim$1.8. In June 2020 it started to brighten, and reached $\sim$20 mCrab in $\sim$2 months. The inclination of this system can be constrained to i<$\sim$30 deg by modeling the reflection spectrum. Starting from late-August ($\sim$59082 MJD), AT2019wey entered into the hard-intermediate state (HIMS), and underwent a few week-long timescale outbursts, where the brightening in soft X-rays is correlated with the enhancement of a thermal component. Low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) was observed in the HIMS. We detect no pulsation and in timing analysis of the NICER and NuSTAR data. The X-ray states and power spectra of AT2019wey are discussed against the landscape of low-mass X-ray binaries.},

@article{Miller2014_MAXIJ1305-704_wind,
abstract = {We report on a high-resolution Chandra/HETG X-ray spectrum of the transient X-ray binary MAXI J1305-704. A rich absorption complex is detected in the Fe L band, including density-sensitive lines from Fe XX, Fe XXI, and Fe XXII. Spectral analysis over three wavelength bands with a large grid of XSTAR photoionization models generally requires a gas density of n ≥ 10 17 cm-3. Assuming a luminosity of L = 1037 erg s-1, fits to the 10-14 {\AA} band constrain the absorbing gas to lie within r = (3.9 ± 0.7) × 103 km from the central engine, or about r = 520 ± 90 (M/5 M ) rg , where rg = GM/c 2. At this small distance from the compact object, gas in stable orbits should have a gravitational redshift of z = v/c ≃ (3 ± 1) × 10 -3 (M/5 M ), and any tenuous inflowing gas should have a free-fall velocity of v/c ≃ (6 ± 1) × 10-2 (M/5 M ) 1/2. The best-fit single-zone photoionization models measure a redshift of v/c = (2.6-3.2) × 10-3. Models with two absorbing zones provide significantly improved fits, and the additional zone is measured to have a redshift of v/c = (4.6-4.9) × 10-2 (models including two zones suggest slightly different radii and may point to lower densities). Thus, the observed shifts are broadly consistent with those expected at the photoionization radius. The absorption spectrum revealed in MAXI J1305-704 may be best explained in terms of a "failed wind" like those predicted in some recent numerical simulations of black hole accretion flows. The robustness of the velocity shifts was explored through detailed simulations with the Chandra/MARX ray-tracing package and analysis of the zeroth-order ACIS-S3 spectrum. These tests are particularly important given the anomalously large angle between the source and the optical axis in this observation. The simulations and ACIS spectrum suggest that the shifts are not instrumental; however, strong caution is warranted. We discuss our results in the context of accretion flows in stellar-mass black holes and active galactic nuclei, as well as the potential role of failed winds in emerging connections between disk outflows and black hole state transitions. {\textcopyright} 2014.

abstract = {We present an optical spectroscopic study of the black hole X-ray transient V4641 Sgr (=SAX J1819.3-2525) covering the 1999, 2002, and 2004 outbursts. The spectra were taken over 22 different epochs during the low-luminosity phases that follow the sharp and bright outburst peaks displayed by the system. The data reveal the frequent presence of wind-related features in H (Balmer) and HeI emission lines in the form of P-Cygni profiles and strong emission lines with broad wings. The terminal velocity of thewind, as measured in the blue-shifted absorption (P-Cygni) components, is in the range of $\sim$ 900-1600 km s-1 , while the broad emission line wings (so-called nebular phases) imply outflow velocities of up to $\sim$3000 km s-1. We show that, at least for several of the wind detections, the radio jet was active and the system was likely in the hard state. This, together with previous detections reported in the literature, shows that V4641 Sgr is the second source of this class, after V404 Cyg, where the presence of these cold wind outflows has been clearly established.We discuss the similar phenomenology observed in both systems as well as the possible nature of the outflow and its impact on the accretion process.},

The source was captured at the peak of a rising "low/hard" state, at a flux of 0.3 Crab. A broad, skewed iron line and disk reflection spectrum are revealed. Fits to the sensitive NuSTAR spectra with a number of relativistically blurred disk reflection models yield strong geometrical constraints on the disk and hard X-ray "corona." Two models that explicitly assume a "lamp post" corona find its base to have a vertical height above the black hole of and h = 18 ± 4 GM/c 2 (90\% confidence errors); models that do not assume a "lamp post" return emissivity profiles that are broadly consistent with coronae of this size. Given that X-ray microlensing studies of quasars and reverberation lags in Seyferts find similarly compact coronae, observations may now signal that compact coronae are fundamental across the black hole mass scale. All of the models fit to GRS 1739-278 find that the accretion disk extends very close to the black hole - the least stringent constraint is . Only two of the models deliver meaningful spin constraints, but a = 0.8 ± 0.2 is consistent with all of the fits. Overall, the data provide especially compelling evidence of an association between compact hard X-ray coronae and the base of relativistic radio jets in black holes.},

abstract = {We present 12 epochs of optical spectroscopy taken across the discovery outburst of the black hole (BH) candidate MAXI J1803−298 with the Gran Telescopio Canarias and Very Large Telescope. The source followed a standard outburst evolution with hard and soft states. The system displays a triangular shape in the hardness intensity diagram, consistent with that seen in high-inclination BH transients and the previously reported detection of X-ray dips. The two epochs observed during the initial hard state exhibited asymmetric emission-line profiles, including a P-Cygni profile simultaneously detected in H $\alpha$ and He i 6678, which indicates the presence of an optical wind in the system. The remaining spectra, obtained during the transition to the soft state and the subsequent decay, are instead characterized by narrower, double-peaked emission lines embedded into broad absorption components. One epoch (intermediate state) also includes near-infrared (NIR) coverage, revealing complex line profiles in the Paschen and Bracket series, which suggests that the outflow is still present during the outburst decay through the soft state. The growing list of low-mass X-ray binaries with optical and NIR outflow signatures indicates that these are common features. Furthermore, the lowest luminosity spectrum exhibits an H $\alpha$ FWHM of 1570 ± 100 km s −1 . This, together with previous constraints on the binary parameters, allows us to favor a compact object mass of ∼3–10 M ⊙ , further supporting its BH nature.},

We discuss the possible explanations for this disagreement and its implications for reflection models, including possible physical scenarios in which either the inner disk is misaligned both with binary orbit and the outer jet, or either the inner accretion flow, corona, and/or jet have vertical structure which leads to lower inferred disk inclination through various physical means.},

@article{Munoz-Darias2016_GS2023+338_wind_hard_visible,
abstract = {A sustained, neutral wind from the outer accretion disk is observed in the transient black hole V404 Cygni during a violent outburst; this unusual wind, which expands at one per cent of the speed of light and triggers a nebular phase once accretion drops sharply and the ejecta become optically thin, probably regulates the outburst evolution of the black hole. Teo Mu{\~{n}}oz-Darias et al. report observations of a sustained outer accretion disk wind in the stellar-mass black hole in the V404 Cygni binary system that is unlike any seen previously. The outflowing wind is neutral, has a large covering factor and expands at 1\% of the speed of light. The luminous, but brief, accretion phases shown by transients with large accretion disks imply that this type of outflow could be a previously unknown factor regulating mass accretion onto black holes. Accretion of matter onto black holes is universally associated with strong radiative feedback1 and powerful outflows2. In particular, black-hole transients3 have outflows whose properties4 are strongly coupled to those of the accretion flow. This includes X-ray winds of ionized material, expelled from the accretion disk encircling the black hole, and collimated radio jets5,6. Very recently, a distinct optical variability pattern has been reported in the transient stellar-mass black hole V404 Cygni, and interpreted as disrupted mass flow into the inner regions of its large accretion disk7. Here we report observations of a sustained outer accretion disk wind in V404 Cyg, which is unlike any seen hitherto. We find that the outflowing wind is neutral, has a large covering factor, expands at one per cent of the speed of light and triggers a nebular phase once accretion drops sharply and the ejecta become optically thin. The large expelled mass (>10−8 solar masses) indicates that the outburst was prematurely ended when a sizeable fraction of the outer disk was depleted by the wind, detaching the inner regions from the rest of the disk. The luminous, but brief, accretion phases shown by transients with large accretion disks2 imply that this outflow is probably a fundamental ingredient in regulating mass accretion onto black holes.},

abstract = {The XMM-Newton spectrum of the black hole candidate XTE J1652-453 shows a broad and strong Fe K$\alpha$ emission line, generally believed to originate from reflection of the inner accretion disc. These data have been analysed by Hiemstra et al. using a variety of phenomenological models.We re-examine the spectrum with a self-consistent relativistic reflection model. A narrow absorption line near 7.2 keV may be present, which if real is likely the Fe XXVI absorption line arising from highly ionized, rapidly outflowing disc wind. The blueshift of this feature corresponds to a velocity of about 11 100 km s-1, which is much larger than the typical values seen in stellar mass black holes. Given that we also find the source to have a low inclination (i {less-than or approximate} 32°; close to face-on), we would therefore be seeing through the very base of outflow. This could be a possible explanation for the unusually high velocity. We use a reflection model combined with a relativistic convolution kernel which allows for both prograde and retrograde black hole spin, and treat the potential absorption feature with a physical model for a photoionized plasma. In this manner, assuming the disc is not truncated, we could only constrain the spin of the black hole in XTE J1652-453 to be less than $\sim$0.5 Jc/GM2 at the 90 per cent confidence limit. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors MNRAS.},

abstract = {Time-resolved SALT spectra of the short-period, dipping X-ray transient, Swift J1357.2-0933, during its 2017 outburst has revealed broad Balmer and He ii $\lambda$4686 absorption features, blueshifted by ∼600 km s-1. Remarkably these features are also variable on the ∼500 s dipping period, indicating their likely association with structure in the inner accretion disc. We interpret this as arising in a dense, hot (30 000 K) outflowing wind seen at very high inclination, and draw comparisons with other accretion disc corona sources. We argue against previous distance estimates of 1.5 kpc and favour a value 6 kpc, implying an X-ray luminosity LX 4 × 1036 erg s-1. Hence it is not a very faint X-ray transient. Our preliminary 1D Monte Carlo radiative transfer and photoionization calculations support this interpretation, as they imply a high intrinsic LX, a column density NH 1024 cm-2, and a low covering factor for the wind. Our study shows that Swift J1357.2-0933 is truly remarkable amongst the cohort of luminous, Galactic X-ray binaries, showing the first example of He ii $\lambda$4686 absorption, the first (and only) variable dip period and is possibly the first black hole 'accretion disc corona' candidate.},

abstract = {We present high time resolution optical spectroscopy and imaging of the black hole transient Swift J1357.2-0933 during its 2017 outburst. The light curves show recurrent dips resembling those discovered during the 2011 outburst. The dip properties (e.g. duration and depth) as well as the evolution of their recurrence time are similar to those seen in 2011. Spectra obtained during the dips are characterized by broad and blueshifted absorptions in Balmer and He II. The absorptions show core velocities of ∼-800 km s-1 and terminal velocities approaching ∼3000 km s-1 i.e. in the upper end of wind velocities measured in other black hole transients (both at optical and X-ray wavelengths). Our observations suggest that the dips are formed in a dense and clumpy outflow, produced near the disc equatorial plane and seen at high inclination. We also study the colour evolution and observe that, as it has been previously reported, the source turns bluer during dips.We show that this is due to a gradual change in the slope of the optical continuum and discuss possible implications of this behaviour.},

abstract = {We present results from simultaneous optical [South African Large Telescope (SALT)] and X-ray (Swift and INTEGRAL) observations of GS 1354-64/BW Cir during the 2015 hard state outburst. During the rising phase, optical/X-ray time series shows a strong anti-correlation with X-ray photons lagging optical. Optical and X-ray power spectra show quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) at a frequency of ∼18 mHz with a confidence level of at least 99 per cent. Simultaneous fitting of Swift/XRT and INTEGRAL spectra in the range 0.5-1000.0 keV shows non-thermal, power-law-dominated (>90 per cent) spectra with a hard power-law index of 1.48 ± 0.03, inner disc temperature of 0.12 ± 0.01 keV and an inner disc radius of ∼3000 km. All evidence is consistent with cyclo-synchrotron radiation in a non-thermal, hot electron cloud extending to ∼100 Schwarzschild radii being a major physical process for the origin of optical photons. At outburst peak about one month later, when the X-ray flux rises and the optical drops, the apparent features in the optical/X-ray correlation vanish and the optical auto correlation widens. Although ∼0.19 Hz QPO is observed from the X-ray power spectra, the optical variability is dominated by the broad-band noise, and the inner disc temperature increases. These results support a change in the dominant optical emission source between outburst rise and peak, consistent with a weakening of hot flow as the disc moves in.},

abstract = {We present a detailed spectral analysis of the Black Hole Binary XTE J1752-223 in the hard state of its 2009 outburst. Regular monitoring of this source by RXTE provided high signal-to-noise spectra along the outburst rise and decay. During one full month this source stalled at $\sim$30\% of its peak count rate at a constant hardness and intensity. By combining all the data in this exceptionally-stable hard state, we obtained an aggregate PCA spectrum (3-45 keV) with 100 million counts, and a corresponding HEXTE spectrum (20-140 keV) with 5.8 million counts. Implementing a version of our reflection code with a physical model for Comptonization, we obtain tight constraints on important physical parameters for this system. In particular, the inner accretion disk is measured very close in, at $R_\mathrm{in}=1.7\pm0.4$ $R_g$. Assuming $R_\mathrm{in}=R_\mathrm{ISCO}$, we find a relatively high black hole spin ($a_*=0.92\pm0.06$). Imposing a lamppost geometry, we obtain a low inclination ($i=35\pm4$ deg), which agrees with the upper limit found in the radio ($i<49$ deg). However, we note that this model cannot be statistically distinguished from a non-lamppost model with free emissivity index, for which the inclination is markedly higher. Additionally, we find a relatively cool corona ($57-70$ keV), and large iron abundance ($3.3-3.7$ solar). We further find that properly accounting for Comptonization of the reflection emission improves the fit significantly and causes an otherwise low reflection fraction ($\sim 0.2-0.3$) to increase by an order of magnitude, in line with geometrical expectations for a lamppost corona. We compare these results with similar investigations reported for GX 339-4 in its bright hard state.},

abstract = {There are few confirmed black holes with a mass of less ∼4 M⊙ and no neutron stars with masses greater than ∼2 M⊙, creating a gap in the observed distribution of compact star masses. We present new optical photometry of the Low mass X-ray binary V1408 Aql, which is a persistent X-ray source thought to contain a black hole. The optical light curve of V1408 Aql shows nearly sinusoidal modulations at the orbital period, superimposed on large night-to-night variations. We combined this photometry with previously published photometry to derive a more precise orbital period of P = 0.388893(3) days. The orbital light curve agrees with a model in which the modulation is caused by the changing aspect of the heated face of the secondary. The lack of eclipses rules out orbital inclinations >65{\"{i}}¿½. Our best models favor inclinations near 13{\"{i}}¿½ and black hole masses near 3 M⊙ with a 90\% upper bound of 6.2 M⊙, and a lower bound of 2.0 M⊙ imposed solely by the maximum mass of neutron stars. We favor a black hole primary over a neutron star based on evidence from the X-ray spectra, the high spin of the compact object, and the lack of any observed type I X-ray bursts. Although uncertainties in the data allow for higher masses, the compact star in V1408 Aql is a candidate for a black hole lying in the mass gap.},

abstract = {After 34 years, the black-hole candidate EXO 1846-031 went into outburst again in 2019. We investigate its spectral properties in the hard intermediate and the soft states with NuSTAR and Insight-HXMT. A reflection component has been detected in the two spectral states but possibly originating from different illumination spectra: in the intermediate state, the illuminating source is attributed to a hard coronal component, which has been commonly observed in other X-ray binaries, whereas in the soft state the reflection is probably produced by the disk self-irradiation. Both cases support EXO 1846-031 as a low inclination system of $\sim$40 degrees. An absorption line is clearly detected at $\sim$7.2 keV in the hard intermediate state, corresponding to a highly ionized disk wind (log {$\xi$} > 6.1) with a velocity up to 0.06c. Meanwhile, quasi-simultaneous radio emissions have been detected before and after the X-rays, implying the co-existence of disk winds and jets in this system. Additionally, the observed wind in this source is potentially driven by magnetic forces. The absorption line disappeared in the soft state and a narrow emission line appeared at $\sim$6.7 keV on top of the reflection component, which may be evidence for disk winds, but data with the higher spectral resolution are required to examine this.},

This high value nominally excludes the possibility of the central engine harboring a neutron star. Using several models, we test the robustness of our measurement to assumptions about the density of the accretion disk, the nature of the corona, the choice of disk continuum model, and addition of reflection from the outer regions of the accretion disk. All tested models agree on a very high black hole spin value and a high value for the inclination of the inner accretion disk of $\theta\approx73^\circ$.

The spin parameter of SWIFT J1753.5-0127 and GRO J1655-40 is estimated by modelling the strong reflection signatures present in their XMM-Newton observations. Using a newly developed, self-consistent reflection model which includes the blackbody radiation of the disc as well as the effect of Comptonization, blurred with a relativistic line function, we infer the spin parameter of SWIFT J1753.5-0127 to be 0.76 +0.11-0.15. The inclination of this system is estimated at 55° +2-7. For GRO J1655-40, we find that the disc is significantly misaligned to the orbital plane, with an innermost inclination of 30° +5-10. Allowing the inclination to be a free parameter, we find a lower limit for the spin of 0.90, this value increases to that of a maximal rotating black hole when the inclination is set to that of the orbital plane of J1655-40. Our technique is independent of the black hole mass and distance, uncertainties in which are among the main contributors to the spin uncertainty in previous works. {\textcopyright} 2009 RAS.},

abstract = {We can't see black holes, they are black on a black background. But we can see where they are, thanks to the bright glow emitted by matter as it falls into the black hole. This disk accretion process is central to much of high-energy astrophysics, but observational clues as to its inner workings are rare. Using remarkable spectra obtained from the stellar-mass black-hole binary GRO J1655–40, Miller et al. have now achieved the long-sought goal of setting observational constraints on the nature of disk accretion onto compact objects. The spectra record an X-ray-absorbing wind that must be powered by a magnetic process that can also drive accretion through the disk. This demonstrates that disk accretion onto black holes is a fundamentally magnetic process. Although disk accretion onto compact objects—white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes—is central to much of high-energy astrophysics, the mechanisms that enable this process have remained observationally difficult to determine. Accretion disks must transfer angular momentum in order for matter to travel radially inward onto the compact object1. Internal viscosity from magnetic processes1,2,3,4 and disk winds5 can both in principle transfer angular momentum, but hitherto we lacked evidence that either occurs. Here we report that an X-ray-absorbing wind discovered in an observation of the stellar-mass black hole binary GRO J1655 - 40 (ref. 6) must be powered by a magnetic process that can also drive accretion through the disk. Detailed spectral analysis and modelling of the wind shows that it can only be powered by pressure generated by magnetic viscosity internal to the disk or magnetocentrifugal forces. This result demonstrates that disk accretion onto black holes is a fundamentally magnetic process.},

abstract = {We present a spectral and timing study of the NuSTAR and Swift observations of the black hole candidate IGR J17091-3624 in the hard state during its outburst in 2016. Disk reflection is detected in each of the NuSTAR spectra taken in three epochs. Fitting with relativistic reflection models reveals that the accretion disk is truncated during all epochs with $R_{\rm in}>10\simr_{\rm g}$, with the data favoring a low disk inclination of $\sim 30^{\circ}-40^{\circ}$. The steepening of the continuum spectra between epochs is accompanied by a decrease in the high energy cut-off: the electron temperature $kT_{\rm e}$ drops from $\sim 64$ keV to $\sim 26$ keV, changing systematically with the source flux. We detect type-C QPOs in the power spectra with frequency varying between 0.131 Hz and 0.327 Hz. In addition, a secondary peak is found in the power spectra centered at about 2.3 times the QPO frequency during all three epochs. The nature of this secondary frequency is uncertain, however a non-harmonic origin is favored. We investigate the evolution of the timing and spectral properties during the rising phase of the outburst and discuss their physical implications.},

@article{Rao2012_IGRJ17091_i_high_2,
abstract = {IGRJ17091-3624 is a transient X-ray source and is believed to be a Galactic black hole candidate. Recently, it has received considerable attention due to the detection of peculiar variability patterns known as "heartbeats," which are quasi-periodic mini-outbursts repeated over timescales ranging between 5 and 70s. So far, such variability patterns have been observed only in GRS1915+105 and these are classified as $\rho$- and $\nu$-variability classes. Here, we present the results of "phase-resolved" spectroscopy of the "heartbeat" oscillations of IGRJ17091-3624 using data from simultaneous observations made by RXTE and XMM-Newton. We find that the 0.7-35keV spectra can be fitted with a "canonical" model for black hole sources consisting of only two components - a multi-temperature disk blackbody and a power law (or its equivalent). We attempt to constrain the system parameters of the source by simultaneously fitting spectra during different phases of the burst profile while tying the system parameters across the phases. The results indicate that the source is a high inclination binary (i > 53°). Further, the observed low flux from the source can be explained only if the black hole spin is very low, along with constraints on the black hole mass (<5 M ⊙) and distance (>20kpc). For higher inclination angles, which is favored by the data, the black hole spin is required to be negative. Thus, low or retrograde spin could be the reason for the low luminosity of the source. {\textcopyright} 2012 The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

We have studied the two-month spectral evolution of the source in detail. Unlike the previous outbursts, the initial transition from the hard to the soft state in 2011 was not followed by the standard spectral evolution expected for a transient black hole binary. IGR J17091-3624 showed pseudo-periodic flare-like events in the light curve, closely resembling those observed from GRS 1915+105. We find evidence that these phenomena are due to the same physical instability process ascribed to GRS 1915+105. Finally, we speculate that the faintness of IGR J17091-3624 could be not only due to the high distance of the source but also due to the high inclination angle of the system. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors MNRAS {\textcopyright} 2012 RAS.},

abstract = {Chandra spectroscopy of transient stellar-mass black holes in outburst has clearly revealed accretion disk winds in soft, disk-dominated states, in apparent anti-correlation with relativistic jets in low/hard states. These disk winds are observed to be highly ionized, dense, and to have typical velocities of 1000kms-1 or less projected along our line of sight. Here, we present an analysis of two Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating spectra of the Galactic black hole candidate IGRJ17091-3624 and contemporaneous Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) radio observations, obtained in 2011. The second Chandra observation reveals an absorption line at 6.91±0.01keV; associating this line with He-like FeXXV requires a blueshift of 9300+500-400kms-1 (0.03c, or the escape velocity at 1000 R Schw). This projected outflow velocity is an order of magnitude higher than has previously been observed in stellar-mass black holes, and is broadly consistent with some of the fastest winds detected in active galactic nuclei. A potential feature at 7.32keV, if due to FeXXVI, would imply a velocity of ∼14, 600kms-1 (0.05c), but this putative feature is marginal. Photoionization modeling suggests that the accretion disk wind in IGRJ17091-3624 may originate within 43,300 Schwarzschild radii of the black hole and may be expelling more gas than it accretes. The contemporaneous EVLA observations strongly indicate that jet activity was indeed quenched at the time of our Chandra observations. We discuss the results in the context of disk winds, jets, and basic accretion disk physics in accreting black hole systems. {\textcopyright} 2012. The American Astronomical Society.

By jointly fitting six NuSTAR and four Swift spectra, we found that during this outburst the source evolves from the hard to the hard/soft intermediate and back to the hard state, similar to the 2011 outburst. Unlike in the previous outburst, in this case we observed both a broad emission and a moderately broad absorption line in our observations. Our fits favour an accretion disc with an inclination angle of ∼45 • with respect to the line of sight and a high iron abundance of 3.5 ± 0.3 in units of the solar abundance. We also observed heartbeat variability in one NuSTAR observation. We fitted the phase-resolved spectra of this observation and found that the reflected emission varies independently from the direct emission, whereas in the fits to the average spectra these two quantities are strongly correlated. Assuming that in IGR J17091-3642 the inner radius of the disc both in the average and the phase-resolved spectra is located at the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit, with 90 per cent confidence the spin parameter of the black hole in this system is −0.13 ≤a * ≤ 0.27.},

Ionized resonance (r) absorption from H- and He-like species of Fe (XXV, XXVI) and possibly Ca XX are also seen as well as possible emission from neutral Fe Kalpha and ionized Fe XXV (forbidden or the resonance emission component of a P Cygni profile). We report the tentative detection of the first astrophysical signature of X-ray absorption fine structure in the photoelectric edge of Si (and possibly Fe and Mg) attributed to material in grains. The large column densities measured from the neutral edges reveal anomalous Si and Fe abundances and illustrate the importance of high-resolution X-ray measurements for assessing material that surrounds bright X-ray sources, especially if depletion onto grains plays a prominent role. Scenarios for which the anomalous abundances can be attributed to surrounding cold material associated with GRS 1915-105 and/or for which the enrichment may signify either a highly unusual supernova/hypernova or external supernova activity local to the binary are discussed. We attribute the ionized features to a hot disk, disk wind, or corona environment. Based on H- and He-like Fe (XXV, XXVI), we estimate constraints on the ionization parameter (log xi greater than or similar to 4.15), temperature (T>2.4x10(6) K), and hydrogen equivalent number density (ngreater than or similar to10(12) cm(-3)) for this region. Variability studies with the simultaneous RXTE data show that the light-curve count rate tracks the changes in the disk blackbody as well as the power-law flux, with the most significant variations observed in the former. The Chandra data show spectral changes that also track the behavior of the light curve and may point to changes in both the ionizing flux and density of the absorber. A 3.69 Hz quasi-periodic oscillation and weak first harmonic are seen in the RXTE data.},

abstract = {We present the results of six Suzaku observations of the recurrent black hole transient 4U 1630-472 during its decline from outburst from February 8 to March 23 in 2006. All observations show the typical high/soft state spectral shape in the 2-50 keV band, roughly described by an optically thick-disk spectrum in the soft energy band plus a weak power-law tail that becomes dominant only above ∼ 20keV. The disk temperature decreases from 1.4keV to 1.2 keV as the flux decreases by a factor of 2, consistent with a constant radius, as expected for disk-dominated spectra. All of the observations reveal significant absorption lines from highly ionized (H-like and He-like) iron K$\alpha$'s at 7.0 keV and 6.7 keV. The energies of these absorption lines suggest a blue shift with an outflow velocity of ∼ 1000 ms-1. The H-like iron K$\alpha$ equivalent width remains approximately constant at ∼ 30 eV over all of the observations, while that of the He-like K$\alpha$ line increases from 7 eV to 20 eV. Thus, the ionization state of the material decreases, as expected from the decline in flux. By fitting the profile with Voigt functions (curve of growth) together with detailed photo-ionization calculations, the total absorbing column, and the ionization parameter were estimated to be (1.0-0.7) × 1023 cm-2 and (6-4) × 104, respectively, for a velocity dispersion of 500km s -1.

abstract = {We report on a detailed optical spectroscopic follow-up of the black hole transient MAXI J1820+070 (ASASSN-18ey). The observations cover the main part of the X-ray binary outburst, when the source alternated between hard and soft states following the classical pattern widely seen in other systems. We focus the analysis on the He I emission lines at 5876 and 6678 Angs, as well as on Halpha. We detect clear accretion disk wind features (P-Cyg profiles and broad emission line wings) in the hard state, both during outburst rise and decay. These are not witnessed during the several months long soft state. However, our data suggest that the visibility of the outflow might be significantly affected by the ionisation state of the accretion disk. The terminal velocity of the wind is above $\sim$ 1200 km/s, which is similar to outflow velocities derived from (hard-state) optical winds and (soft-state) X-ray winds in other systems. The wind signatures, in particular the P-Cyg profiles, are very shallow, and their detection has only been possible thanks to a combination of source brightness and intense monitoring at very high signal-to-noise. This study indicates that cold, optical winds are most likely a common feature of black hole accretion, and therefore, that wind-like outflows are a general mechanism of mass and angular momentum removal operating throughout the entire X-ray binary outburst.},

abstract = {Stellar-mass black holes with relativistic jets, also known as microquasars, mimic the behaviour of quasars and active galactic nuclei. Because timescales around stellar-mass black holes are orders of magnitude smaller than those around more distant supermassive black holes, microquasars are ideal nearby laboratories for studying the evolution of accretion disks and jet formation in black-hole systems. Whereas studies of black holes have revealed a complex array of accretion activity, the mechanisms that trigger and suppress jet formation remain a mystery. Here we report the presence of a broad emission line in the faint, hard states and narrow absorption lines in the bright, soft states of the microquasar GRS 1915+105. (Hard and soft denote the character of the emitted X-rays.) Because the hard states exhibit prominent radio jets, we argue that the broad emission line arises when the jet illuminates the inner accretion disk. The jet is weak or absent during the soft states, and we show that the absorption lines originate when the powerful radiation field around the black hole drives a hot wind off the accretion disk. Our analysis shows that this wind carries enough mass away from the disk to halt the flow of matter into the radio jet. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

@article{Neilsen2020_GRS1915+105_obscured_NICER_winds_hard,
abstract = {After 26 yr in outburst, the black hole X-ray binary GRS 1915+105 dimmed considerably in early 2018; its flux dropped sharply in mid-2019, and it has remained faint ever since. This faint period, the "obscured state," is punctuated by occasional X-ray flares, many of which have been observed by NICER as part of our regular monitoring program. Here we present detailed time-resolved spectroscopy of one bright flare, whose spectrum shows evidence of high column density partial covering absorption and extremely deep absorption lines (equivalent widths over 100 eV in some cases). We study the time-dependent ionization of the obscuring gas with XSTAR, ultimately attributing the absorption to a radially stratified absorber of density ∼10 12-10 13 cm −3 at ∼few×10 11 cm from the black hole. We argue that a vertically extended outer disk could explain this obscuration. We discuss several scenarios to explain the obscured state, including massive outflows, an increase in the mass accretion rate, and changes in the outer disk that herald the approach of quiescence, but none are entirely satisfactory. Alternative explanations, such as obscuration by the accretion stream impact point, may be testable with current or future data.

abstract = {We present new results of uniform spectral analysis of Swift/XRT observations of the X-ray binary system 4U 1957+11. This includes 26 observations of the source made between MJD 54282$-$55890 (2007 July 01 $-$ 2011 November 25). All 26 spectra are predominantly thermal, and can be modeled well with emission from an accretion disk around a black hole. We analyze all 26 spectra jointly using traditional chi-squared fitting as well as Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. The results from both methods agree, and constrains on model parameters like inclination, column density, and black hole spin. These results indicate that the X-ray emitting inner accretion disk is inclined to our line-of-sight by $77.6^{+1.5}_{-2.2}$ degrees. Additionally, the other constraints we obtain on parameters like the column density and black hole spin are consistent with previous X-ray observations. Distances less than 5 kpc are unlikely and not only ruled out based on our analysis but also from other independent observations. Based on model-derived bolometric luminosities, we require the source distance to be >10 kpc if the black hole's mass is >10 M$_{Sun}$. If the hole's mass is <10 M$_{Sun}$, then the distance could be in the range of 5$-$10 kpc.},

abstract = {1E 1740.7-2942 is one of the strongest hard X-ray emitters in the Galactic Centre region, believed to be a black hole in a high-mass X-ray binary system. Although extensively studied in X-rays, many aspects about the underlying nature of the system are still unknown. For example, X-ray data analyses of 1E 1740.7-2942 up to date have not yet unveiled the signature of a reflection component, whose modelling could be used to estimate parameters such as the spin of the black hole and inclination of the disc. We report here on the determination of these parameters from the analysis of the reflection component present in a public \textit{NuSTAR} observation which hasn't been subject to any previous study. We include \textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{INTEGRAL} data to build a combined spectrum, enabling a joint analysis of both the disc and comptonisation components. Results point to a relatively high inclination disc $\gtrsim$ 50$^{\circ}$ (3 $\sigma$) and a near-maximum speed rotating black hole. The former is in agreement with a previous radio study and the latter is reported here for the first time. Lastly, we follow the methodology of recent efforts to weight black holes with only X-ray spectra and find results that suggest a black hole mass of about 5 M$_\odot$ for 1E 1740.7-2942.},

abstract = {We present the broad-band spectral analysis of all the six hard, intermediate, and soft state NuSTAR observations of the recently discovered transient black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348-630 during its first outburst in 2019. We first model the data with a combination of a multicolour disc and a relativistic blurred reflection, and, whenever needed, a distant reflection. We find that this simple model scheme is inadequate in explaining the spectra, resulting in a very high iron abundance. We therefore explore the possibility of reflection from a high-density disc. We use two different sets of models to describe the high-density disc reflection: RELXILL-based reflection models, and REFLIONX-based ones. The REFLIONX-based high-density disc reflection models bring down the iron abundance to around the solar value, while the density is found to be 1020.3-21.4 cm-3. We also find evidence of a high-velocity outflow in the form of ∼7.3 keV absorption lines. The consistency between the best-fitting parameters for different epochs and the statistical significance of the corresponding model indicates the existence of high-density disc reflection in MAXI J1348-630.},

abstract = {A small group of X-ray binaries currently provides the best evidence for the existence of stellar-mass black holes. These objects are interacting binary systems where the X-rays arise from accretion of material onto a compact object ( i.e., an object with a radius of less than a few hundred km). In some favourable cases, optical studies of the companion star lead to dynamical mass estimates for both components. In 17 cases, the mass of the compact object in an X-ray binary has been shown to exceed the maximum mass of a stable neutron star (about 3 M ⊙ ), which leads to the conclusion that these objects are black holes. In this contribution I will review the basic properties of these black hole binaries.},

abstract = {We examine ∼10 yr of photometric data and find that the black hole X-ray binary V4641 Sgr has two optical states, passive and active, during X-ray quiescence. The passive state is dominated by ellipsoidal variations and is stable in the shape and variability of the light curve. The active state is brighter and more variable. Emission during the active state varies over the course of the orbital period and is redder than the companion star. These optical/infrared states last for weeks or months. V4641 Sgr spends approximately 85\% of X-ray quiescence in the passive state and 15\% in the active. We analyze passive colors and spectroscopy of V4641 Sgr and show that they are consistent with a reddened B9III star (with E(B-V) = 0.37 ± 0.19) with little or no contribution from the accretion disk. We use X-ray observations with an updated ephemeris to place an upper limit on the duration of an X-ray eclipse of <8.°3 in phase (∼1.6 hr). High-resolution spectroscopy yields a greatly improved measurement of the rotational velocity of the companion star of V rotsin i = 100.9 ± 0.8 km s-1. We fit ellipsoidal models to the passive state data and find an inclination angle of i = 72.3 ± 4.°1, a mass ratio of Q = 2.2 ± 0.2, and component masses for the system of M BH = 6.4 ± 0.6 M and M 2 = 2.9 ± 0.4 M.

The large contribution of the accretion flow to the total luminosity prevents the direct detection of the companion. Nevertheless, we constrain the non-stellar contribution to be larger than $\sim$80 per cent of the total optical light, which sets new lower limits to the distance (d > 2.29 kpc) and the height over the Galactic plane (z > 1.75 kpc). This places the system in the Galactic thick disc. We measure a modulation in the centroid of the Ha line with a period of P = 0.11 ± 0.04 d which, combined with the recently presented full width at half-maximum-K2 correlation, results in a massive black hole (M1 > 9.3M⊙) and an $\sim$M2V companion star (M2 $\sim$ 0.4M).We also present further evidence supporting a very high orbital inclination (i ≳ 80°).},

abstract = {MAXI J1659-152 is a bright X-ray transient black-hole candidate binary system discovered in September 2010. We report here on MAXI, RXTE, Swift, and XMM-Newton observations during its 2010/2011 outburst. We find that during the first one and a half week of the outburst the X-ray light curves display drops in intensity at regular intervals, which we interpret as absorption dips. About three weeks into the outbursts, again drops in intensity are seen. These dips have, however, a spectral behaviour opposite to that of the absorption dips, and are related to fast spectral state changes (hence referred to as transition dips). The absorption dips recur with a period of 2.414 ± 0.005 h, which we interpret as the orbital period of the system. This implies that MAXI J1659-152 is the shortest period black-hole candidate binary known to date. The inclination of the accretion disk with respect to the line of sight is estimated to be 65-80. We propose the companion to the black-hole candidate to be close to an M5 dwarf star, with a mass and radius of about 0.15-0.25 M {\^{a}}{\v{S}}™ and 0.2-0.25 R {\^{a}}{\v{S}}™, respectively. We derive that the companion had an initial mass of about 1.5 M{\^{a}}{\v{S}}™, which evolved to its current mass in about 5-6 billion years. The system is rather compact (orbital separation of {\^{a}}‰1.33 R {\^{a}}{\v{S}}™), and is located at a distance of 8.6 ± 3.7 kpc, with a height above the Galactic plane of 2.4 ± 1.0 kpc. The characteristics of short orbital period and high Galactic scale height are shared with two other transient black-hole candidate X-ray binaries, i.e., XTE J1118+480 and Swift J1735.5-0127. We suggest that all three are kicked out of the Galactic plane into the halo, rather than being formed in a globular cluster. {\textcopyright} ESO, 2013.},

abstract = {Using high-precision astrometric optical observations from the Walter Baade Magellan Telescope in conjunction with high-resolution very long baseline interferometric (VLBI) radio imaging with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), we have located the core of the X-ray binary system XTE J1752-223. Compact radio emission from the core was detected following the state transition from the soft to the hard X-ray state. Its position to the south-east of all previously detected jet components mandated a re-analysis of the existing VLBI data. Our analysis suggests that the outburst comprised at least two ejection events prior to 2010 February 26. No radio-emitting components were detected to the south-east of the core at any epoch, suggesting that the receding jets were Doppler-deboosted below our sensitivity limit. From the ratio of the brightness of the detected components to the measured upper limits for the receding ejecta, we constrain the jet speed $\beta$ > 0.66 and the inclination angle to the line of sight $\theta$ < 49°. Assuming that the initial ejection event occurred at the transition from the hard intermediate state to the soft intermediate state, an initial period of ballistic motion followed by a Sedov phase (i.e. self-similar adiabatic expansion) appears to fit the motion of the ejecta better than a uniform deceleration model. The accurate core location can provide a long time baseline for a future proper motion determination should the system show a second outburst, providing insights into the formation mechanism of the compact object. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors MNRAS {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

abstract = {We present a spectral and timing analysis of the newly reported Galactic X-ray transient Swift J1658.2-4242 by NuSTAR and Swift. The broad-band X-ray continuum is typical of a black hole binary in the bright hard state, with a photon-index $\Gamma=1.63\pm0.02$ and a low coronal temperature of $kT_{\rm e}=22\pm1$ keV, corresponding to a low spectral cutoff well constrained by NuSTAR. Spectral modeling of the relativistic disk reflection features, consisting of a broad Fe K$\alpha$ line and the Compton reflection hump, reveals the black hole is rapidly spinning with the spin parameter of $a_{*}>0.96$, and the inner accretion disk is viewed at a high inclination angle of $i=64^{+2}_{-3}{^\circ}$. The high inclination is independently confirmed by dips in the light curves, which can be explained by obscuring material located near the disk plane temporarily obscuring the central region. In addition, we detect an absorption line in the NuSTAR spectra centered at $7.03^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ keV. If associated with ionized Fe K absorption lines, this provides evidence for the presence of outflowing material in the hard state of a black hole binary candidate. A timing analysis shows the presence of a type-C QPO in the power spectrum, with frequency increasing from $\sim0.14$ Hz to $\sim0.21$ Hz during the single NuSTAR exposure. Our analysis reveals that Swift J1658.2-4242 displays characteristics typical for a black hole binary that is viewed close to edge-on, making it a good system for studying the accretion geometry in black hole binaries.},

abstract = {During its 2003 outburst, the black hole X-ray transient H1743-322 produced two-sided radio and X-ray jets. Applying a simple and symmetric kinematic model to the trajectories of these jets, we determine the source distance, 8.5 0.8kpc, and the inclination angle of the jets, 75°3°. Using these values, we estimate the spin of the black hole by fitting its Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer spectra, obtained during the 2003 outburst, to a standard relativistic accretion-disk model. For its spin, we find a * = 0.2 0.3 (68\% limits), -0.3 < a * < 0.7 at 90\% confidence. We strongly rule against an extreme value of spin: a * < 0.92 at 99.7\% confidence. H1743-322 is the third known microquasar (after A0620-00 and XTEJ1550-564) that displays large-scale ballistic jets and has a moderate value of spin. Our result, which depends on an empirical distribution of black hole masses, takes into account all known sources of measurement error. {\textcopyright} 2012. The American Astronomical Society.

abstract = {We present intermediate resolution spectroscopy of the optical counterpart to the black hole X-ray transient MAXI J1820+070 (=ASASSN-18ey) obtained with the OSIRIS spectrograph on the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. The observations were performed with the source close to the quiescent state and before the onset of renewed activity in August 2019. We make use of these data and K-type dwarf templates taken with the same instrumental configuration to measure the projected rotational velocity of the donor star. We find $v_{rot} \sin i = 84 \pm 5$ km s$^{-1}$ ($1\!-\!\sigma$), which implies a donor to black-hole mass ratio $q = {M_2}/{M_1} = 0.072 \pm 0.012$ for the case of a tidally locked and Roche-lobe filling donor star. The derived dynamical masses for the stellar components are $M_1 = (5.95 \pm 0.22)\sin ^{-3}i$ $M_\odot$ and $M_2 = (0.43 \pm 0.08) \sin^{-3}i$ $M_\odot$. The use of $q$, combined with estimates of the accretion disk size at the time of the optical spectroscopy, allows us to revise our previous orbital inclination constraints to $66^{\circ} < i < 81^{\circ}$. These values lead to 95\% confidence level limits on the masses of $5.73 <M_1(M_\odot) < 8.34$ and $0.28 < M_2(M_\odot) < 0.77$. Adopting instead the $63 \pm 3^{\circ}$ orientation angle of the radio jet as the binary inclination leads to $M_1 = 8.48^{+0.79}_{-0.72} M_\odot$ and $M_2 = 0.61^{+0.13}_{-0.12} M_\odot$ ($1\!-\!\sigma$).},

From our observations and data taken from the literature we derive a refined ephemeris for inferior conjunction of the secondary star: HJD 244 9838.4198(52) + 2.62168(14) × N. We have modeled the V, R, and i band light curves in terms of a Roche lobe filling secondary and an accretion disk around the compact star, the latter described as a flat cylinder with a radial temperature distribution. From the shape of the light curve we constrain the binary inclination and mass of the secondary star to lie in the ranges 63°.7-70°.7 and 1.60-3.10 M⊙, respectively. This limits the mass of the black-hole to the range 6.29-7.60 M⊙. The mass range we obtained for the secondary star is supported by the results of stellar evolution calculations.},

Cross-correlation of the 21 individual spectra against late-type templates reveals a sinusoidal velocity modulation with a period of 0.68549 +/- 0.00001 d and semi-amplitude of 417.7 +/- 3.9 km/s. We derive a mass function f(M) = 5.18 +/- 0.15 Msun, dynamically confirming the black hole nature of the compact object. Our analysis of the stellar absorption features supports a K3-5 spectral classification for the donor star, which contributes 20\% of the total flux at 5200-6800 Angs. The photometric 0.703 +/- 0.003 d periodicity observed during outburst is 2.6\% longer than the orbital period supporting the presence of a superhump modulation in the outburst lightcurves. In line with this interpretation, we constrain the binary mass ratio to be q=0.12. In addition, we observe a sharp increase in the Halpha emission line equivalent width during inferior conjunction of the donor star that we interpret as a grazing eclipse of the accretion disc and allows us to constrain the binary inclination to > 69 deg. On the other hand, the absence of X-ray eclipses during outburst imply i < 77 deg. These inclination limits, together with our dynamical solution, lead to a black hole mass in the range 7-8 Msun. We also measure a systemic velocity = -21.6 +/- 2.3 km/s which, combined with the Gaia DR2 proper motion and parallax, implies a large peculiar velocity of 100 km/s.},

abstract = {Using the Very Long Baseline Array, we have measured a trigonometric parallax for the microquasar GRS1915+105, which contains a black hole and a K-giant companion. This yields a direct distance estimate of 8.6-1.6+2.0 kpc and a revised estimate for the mass of the black hole of 12.4-1.8+2.0M⊙. GRS 1915+105 is at about the same distance as some H II regions and water masers associated with high-mass star formation in the Sagittarius spiral arm of the Galaxy. The absolute proper motion of GRS 1915+105 is -3.19 ± 0.03 mas yr-1 and -6.24 ± 0.05 mas yr-1 toward the east and north, respectively, which corresponds to a modest peculiar speed of 22 ± 24 km s-1 at the parallax distance, suggesting that the binary did not receive a large velocity kick when the black hole formed. On one observational epoch, GRS 1915+105 displayed superluminal motion along the direction of its approaching jet. Considering previous observations of jet motions, the jet in GRS 1915+105 can be modeled with a jet inclination to the line of sight of 60° ± 5° and a variable flow speed between 0.65c and 0.81c, which possibly indicates deceleration of the jet at distances from the black hole ≳2000AU. Finally, using our measurements of distance and estimates of black hole mass and inclination, we provisionally confirm our earlier result that the black hole is spinning very rapidly.},

abstract = {We obtained 16 VLT/X-shooter observations of GX 339-4 in quiescence in the period May - September 2016 and detected absorption lines from the donor star in its NIR spectrum. This allows us to measure the radial velocity curve and projected rotational velocity of the donor for the first time. We confirm the 1.76 day orbital period and we find that $K_2$ = $219 \pm 3$ km s$^{-1}$, $\gamma = 26 \pm 2$ km s$^{-1}$ and $v \sin i = 64 \pm 8$ km s$^{-1}$. From these values we compute a mass function $f(M) =1.91 \pm 0.08\simM_{\odot}$, a factor $\sim 3$ lower than previously reported, and a mass ratio $q = 0.18 \pm 0.05$. We confirm the donor is a K-type star and estimate that it contributes $\sim 45-50\%$ of the light in the $J$- and H-band. We constrain the binary inclination to $37^\circ < i < 78^\circ$ and the black hole mass to $2.3\simM_{\odot} < M_\mathrm{BH} < 9.5\simM_{\odot}$.

abstract = {We have conducted spectral and photometric observations of the quiescent optical counterpart of X-ray Nova Ophiuchi 1977 (H1705-250; V2107 Oph) at CTIO. Fifty hours of photometry during 1994 July reveal a typical double-wave modulation of + 0.2 mag with a period of 12.51 + 0.03 hr. The mean brightness was V 21.5. Forty spectra (2000 s exposures) were obtained in 1994 July and 13 similar spectra were obtained in 1993 May. We derived the absorption-line radial velocities using two conventional cross-correlation techniques. Both of them suggest a velocity semiamplitude (K) in excess of 400 km S 1, but only half or less of the spectra could be utilized because the signal-to-noise ratio is so low. Consequently, we devised a new and powerful "restframe search" technique that uses all of the available data. For each of several million binary ephemerides, we summed all of the spectra in a trial restframe of the secondary star, and each restframe spectrum was cross-correlated against a template spectrum with a well-known velocity. We then searched for the set of orbital parameters that produced the strongest cross-correlation value. The results confirmed the photometric period and the best restframe spectrum has a highly significant correlation (r 6) against a broad range of K star templates. The best value for the velocity amplitude is K = 420 + 30 km - 1 The corresponding mass function is f(M) = 4.0 + 0.8 M0. The probability is high that the compact object exceeds the maximum mass ( 3 M0) for a neutron star. Furthermore, this nova is very similar in many respects to the dynamical black hole binaries, A0620-00 and X-ray Nova Muscae 1991. We conclude that X-ray Nova Oph 1977 is the sixth confirmed example of an X-ray binary with a black hole primary. The estimated magnitude of the secondary star is V 22.0. This distance to the binary system is 6 kpc, if the companion is a K3 star near the main sequence. Double-peaked H$\alpha$ emission suggests low levels of accretion 17 yr after outburst, similar to the behavior seen in A0620 -00. Unusual structure in the H$\alpha$ line profile was observed during 1994 July, and its cause remains unexplained. The most straightforward interpretations of the light curves confine the binary inclination angle to the range of 600 80 . In that case, the mass of the black hole primary is 6 + 1 M0, if the companion is a K3 star on the main sequence.},

Photometric observations taken during 2000 and 2008 reveal the presence of the secondary star's ellipsoidal modulation. Further photometry obtained in 2010 shows the system ≃1 mag brighter than its quiescence level and the ellipsoidal modulation diluted by strong flaring activity. Spectroscopic data obtained with the 10.4-m GTC in 2010 reveal radial velocity variations of $\sim$500 km s-1 over 3 h. A simultaneous fit to the photometry and spectroscopy using sinusoids to represent the secondary star's ellipsoidal and radial velocity variations, yields an orbital period of 6.58 ± 0.05 h and a secondary star's radial velocity semi-amplitude of K2 = 541 ± 70 km s-1.

The resulting mass function is f(M) = 0.22 +/- 0.02 M&sun;. We classify the secondary star as A2 V, in agreement with previous work, and measure Teff = 9000 +/- 500 K and E(B-V) = 0.50 +/- 0.05 from fits to synthetic spectra. We derive a distance of d = 9.1 +/- 1.1 kpc if the secondary is on the main sequence. We see no emission lines from the accretion disk, and the measured fractions of disk light in the B- and V-bands are 10\% and 21\%, respectively. The V and I light curves exhibit two waves per orbital cycle with amplitudes $\sim$0.08 mag. We model the light curves as ellipsoidal variations in the secondary star and derive extreme inclination limits of 20 deg <= i <= 40 deg. The formal 3 sigma limits on the inclination from a simultaneous fit to the V and I light curves are 24 deg <= i <= 36 deg for a mass ratio Q = M1/M2 >= 1. However, there are systematic effects in the data that the model does not account for, so the above constraints should be treated with caution. We argue that the secondary star is still on the main sequence with the mass transfer being driven by expansion due to normal main sequence evolution. If the secondary star has a mass near the main sequence values for early A stars (2.3 <= M2 <= 2.6 M&sun;), then the best fits for the 3 sigma inclination range (24 deg <= i <= 36 deg) and the 3 sigma mass function range (0.16 <= f(M) <= 0.28 M&sun;) imply a primary mass in the range 2.7 <= M1 <= 7.5 M&sun;. The mass of the compact object in 4U 1543-47 is likely to be in excess of $\sim$3 M&sun;, which is widely regarded as the maximum mass of a stable neutron star.

abstract = {MAXI J1305-704 has been proposed as a high-inclination candidate black hole X-ray binary in view of its X-ray properties and dipping behaviour during outburst. We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the source in quiescence that allow us to reveal the ellipsoidal modulation of the companion star and absorption features consistent with those of an early K-type star (Teff = 4610 +130 -160 K). The central wavelengths of the absorption lines vary periodically at Porb = 0.394 +- 0.004 d with an amplitude of K2 = 554 +- 8 km/s . They imply a mass function for the compact object of f(M1) = 6.9 +- 0.3 Msun, confirming its black hole nature. The simultaneous absence of X-ray eclipses and the presence of dips set a conservative range of allowed inclinations 60 deg < i < 82 deg, while modelling of optical light curves further constrain it to i = 72 +5 -8 deg. The above parameters together set a black hole mass of M1 = 8.9 +1.6 -1.0 Msun and a companion mass of M2=0.43 +- 0.16 Msun, much lower than that of a dwarf star of the observed spectral type, implying it is evolved. Estimates of the distance to the system (d = 7.5 +1.8 -1.4 kpc) and space velocity (vspace = 270 +- 60 km/s ) place it in the Galactic thick disc and favour a significant natal kick during the formation of the BH if the supernova occurred in the Galactic Plane.},

abstract = {We have obtained optical and infrared photometry of the quiescent soft X-ray transient XTE J1118+480. In addition to optical and J-band variations, we present the ﬁrst observed H- and Ks-band ellipsoidal variations for this system. We model the variations in all bands simultaneously with the WD98 light curve modeling code. The infrared colors of the secondary star in this system are consistent with a spectral type of K7 V, while there is evidence for light from the accretion disk in the optical. Combining the models with the observed spectral energy distribution of the system, the most likely value for the orbital inclination angle is 68 {\AE} 2 . This inclination angle corresponds to a primary black hole mass of 8:53 {\AE} 0:60 M . Based on the derived physical parameters and infrared colors of the system, we determine a distance of 1:72 {\AE} 0:10 kpc to XTE J1118+480.},

abstract = {(shortened) Spectroscopic observations of the fast X-ray transient and superluminal jet source SAX J1819.3-2525 (V4641 Sgr) reveal a best fitting period of P_spect=2.81678 +/- 0.00056 days and a semiamplitude of K_2=211.0 +/- 3.1 km/sec. The optical mass function is f(M)=2.74 +/- 0.12 solar masses. We find a photometric period of P_photo=2.81730 +/- 0.00001 days using a light curve measured from photographic plates. The folded light curve resembles an ellipsoidal light curve with two maxima of roughly equal height and two minima of unequal depth per orbital cycle. The secondary star is a late B-type star which has evolved off the main sequence. Using a moderate resolution spectrum (R=7000) we measure T_eff=10500 +/- 200K, log(g)=3.5 +/- 0.1, and V_rot*sin(i)=123 +/- 4 km/sec (1 sigma errors). Assuming synchronous rotation, our measured value of the projected rotational velocity implies a mass ratio of Q=M_1/M_2=1.50 +/- 0.08 (1sigma). The lack of X-ray eclipses implies an upper limit to the inclination of i<70.7 deg. On the other hand, the large amplitude of the folded light curve (about 0.5 mag) implies a large inclination (i>60 deg). Using the above mass function, mass ratio, and inclination range, the mass of the compact object is in the range 8.73 < M_1 < 11.70 solar masses and the mass of the secondary star is in the range 5.49 < M_2 < 8.14 solar masses (90\% confidence). The mass of the compact object is well above the maximum mass of a stable neutron star and we conclude that V4641 Sgr contains a black hole.},

abstract = {We present an improved dynamical model of the X-ray binary and microquasar XTE J1550-564 based on new moderate-resolution optical spectroscopy and near-infrared photometry obtained with the 6.5m Magellan Telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory. Twelve spectra of the source were obtained using the Magellan Echellette Spectrograph between 2008 May 6 and August 4. In addition, several hundred images of the field were obtained between 2006 May and 2009 July in the J and KS filters using the PANIC camera. The agreement between the 2006/2007 and 2008 J and KS light curves is not perfect, and the differences can plausibly be attributed to a hot spot on the accretion disk during the 2006/2007 observations. By combining our new radial velocity measurements with previous measurements obtained in 2001 May at the 8.2m Very Large Telescope and with light curves, we find an orbital period of P = 1.5420333 0.0000024 days and a radial velocity semiamplitude of K 2 = 363.14 5.97kms-1, which together imply an optical mass function of f(M) = 7.65 0.38 M 1. We find that the projected rotational velocity of the secondary star is 55 5kms-1, which implies a very extreme mass ratio of Q ≡ M/M 2 30. Using a model of a Roche lobe-filling star and an azimuthally symmetric accretion disk, we fit simultaneously optical light curves from 2001, near-infrared light curves from 2008, and all of the radial velocity measurements to derive system parameters. We find an inclination of 747 38 and component masses of M 2 = 0.30 0.07 M 1 and M = 9.10 0.61 M 1 for the secondary star and black hole, respectively. We note that these results depend on the assumption that in 2008, the disk did not have a hot spot, and that the fraction of light contributed by the accretion disk did not change between the spectroscopic and photometric observations. By considering two measured values of the disk fraction and by modeling various combinations of NIR and optical light curves, we show that our adopted black hole mass is probably not seriously in error, where the black hole mass ranges between M = 8.91 1.10 M 1 and M = 13.94 1.64 M 1. The radius of the secondary star for the adopted model is 1.75 0.12 R 1. Using this radius, the average KS magnitude, and an extinction of AK = 0.507 0.050mag, we find a distance of 4.38+0.58-0.41kpc, which is in good agreement with a recent distance estimate based on H I absorption lines. {\textcopyright} 2011.

@article{Orosz2004_XTEJ1650-500_D,
abstract = {We present R-band photometry of the X-ray transient and candidate black hole binary XTE J1650-500 obtained between 2003 May and August with the 6.5 m Clay telescope. A timing analysis of these data reveals a photometric period of 0.3205 ± 0.0007 days (i.e., 7.63 hr) with a possible alias at 0.3785 days (9.12 hr). Our photometry completely rules out the previously published spectroscopic period of 0.212 days (5.09 hr). Consequently, we reanalyzed the 15 archival ESO VLT spectra (obtained 2002 June by Sanchez-Fernandez et al.) that were the basis of the previously published spectroscopic period. We used a rest-frame search technique that is well suited for cases in which the signal-to-noise ratio of individual spectra is low. For each of roughly 1.1 million binary ephemerides, we summed all of the spectra in a trial rest frame of the secondary star, and each rest-frame spectrum was cross-correlated against a template spectrum. We then searched for the set of orbital parameters that produced the strongest cross-correlation value. The results confirmed the photometric period of 0.3205 days and ruled out the alias period near 0.38 days. The best value for the velocity semiamplitude of the companion star is K2 = 435 ± 30 km s-1, and the corresponding optical mass function is f(M) = 2.73 ± 0.56 M☉. The spectral type of the companion star is not well constrained because we only have six template spectra available to us. The K4 V template provides the best match; next-best matches are provided by the G5 V and K2 III templates. We also find that the accretion disk dominates the light in the R band where the disk fraction is 80\% or higher, although this value should be treated with caution owing to the poor signal-to-noise ratio and the limited number of templates. The amplitude of the phased R-band light curve is 0.2 mag, which gives a lower limit to the inclination of 50° ± 3° in the limiting case of no contribution to the R-band light curve from the accretion disk. If the mass ratio of XTE J1650-500 is similar to the mass ratios of other black hole binaries, such as A0620-00 or GRS 1124-683 (e.g., Q 10), then our lower limit to the inclination gives an upper limit to the mass of the black hole in XTE J1650-500 of M1 7.3 M☉. However, the mass can be considerably lower if the R-band flux is dominated by the accretion disk. For example, if the accretion disk does contribute 80\% of the flux, as our preliminary results suggest, then the black hole mass would be only about 4 M☉.},

@article{Khargharia2010_GS2023+338_D_i_mass,
abstract = {We present near-infrared (NIR) broadband (0.80-2.42 $\mu$m) spectroscopy of two low-mass X-ray binaries: V404Cyg and CenX-4. One important parameter required in the determination of the mass of the compact objects in these systems is the binary inclination. We can determine the inclination by modeling the ellipsoidal modulations of the Roche-lobe filling donor star, but the contamination of the donor star light from other components of the binary, particularly the accretion disk, must be taken into account. To this end, we determined the donor star contribution to the infrared flux by comparing the spectra of V404Cyg and CenX-4 to those of various field K-stars of known spectral type. For V404Cyg, we determined that the donor star has a spectral type of K3III. We determined the fractional donor contribution to the NIR flux in the H and K bands as 0.98 ± 0.05 and 0.97 ± 0.09, respectively. We remodeled the H-band light curve from Sanwal et al. after correcting for the donor star contribution to obtain a new value for the binary inclination. From this, we determined the mass of the black hole in V404Cyg to be M BH = 9.0+0.2-0.6 M ⊙. We performed the same spectral analysis for CenX-4 and found the spectral type of the donor star to be in the range K5-M1 V. The donor star contribution in CenX-4 is 0.94 ± 0.14 in the H band while in the K band, the accretion disk can contribute up to 10\% of the infrared flux. We remodeled the H-band light curve from Shahbaz et al., again correcting for the fractional contribution of the donor star to obtain the inclination. From this, we determined the mass of the neutron star as M NS = 1.5+0.1-0.4 M ⊙. However, the masses obtained for both systems should be viewed with some caution since contemporaneous light curve and spectral data are required to obtain definitive masses. {\textcopyright} 2010.

abstract = {With the advent of more sensitive all-sky instruments, the transient Universe is being probed in greater depth than ever before. Taking advantage of available resources, we have established a comprehensive database of black hole (and black hole candidate) X-ray binary (BHXB) activity between 1996 and 2015 as revealed by all-sky instruments, scanning surveys, and select narrow-field X-ray instruments aboard the INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL), Monitor of All-Sky X-ray Image (MAXI), Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE), and Swift telescopes; the Whole-sky Alberta Time-resolved Comprehensive black-Hole Database Of the Galaxy or WATCHDOG. Over the past two decades, we have detected 132 transient outbursts, tracked and classified behavior occurring in 47 transient and 10 persistently accreting BHs, and performed a statistical study on a number of outburst properties across the Galactic population. We find that outbursts undergone by BHXBs that do not reach the thermally dominant accretion state make up a substantial fraction ($\sim$ 40\%) of the Galactic transient BHXB outburst sample over the past $\sim20$ years. Our findings suggest that this "hard-only" behavior, observed in transient and persistently accreting BHXBs, is neither a rare nor recent phenomenon and may be indicative of an underlying physical process, relatively common among binary BHs, involving the mass-transfer rate onto the BH remaining at a low level rather than increasing as the outburst evolves. We discuss how the larger number of these "hard-only" outbursts and detected outbursts in general have significant implications for both the luminosity function and mass-transfer history of the Galactic BHXB population.},

Methods. We collect near-infrared, optical, and X-ray information spread over hundreds of references to study the population of black holes in X-ray transients as a whole. Results. We present the most updated catalogue of black hole transients. This contains X-ray, optical, and near-infrared observations, together with their astrometric and dynamical properties. The catalogue provides new and useful information in both statistical and observational parameters and provides a thorough and complete overview of the black hole population in the Milky Way. Analysing the distances and spatial distribution of the observed systems, we estimate a total population of ∼1300 Galactic black hole transients.
